Hoey, who also played at Kingsbarns, carded a second straight six-under 66 to join him on 12-under 132.The 20-year-old Fleetwood has already earned his place on the 2012 European Tour and has now set his sights higher.\"The last couple of weeks I've had no pressure on me really. I know where I'm playing next year, which is great, and it's definitely given me confidence because there was a bit of thought of 'Can I win?' because I had been in there so many times.\"I finally got it done, so let's see if I can do it on the bigger stage now,\" he told the official European Tour website.But both men face a significant challenge from many of golf's big names with five of the top six ranked players in the world playing at the tournament, which also uses Carnoustie and St  Andrews where the final round takes place Sunday.South African Louis Oosthuizen, who lifted the British Open at St Andrews in 2010, is one off the lead after adding a 67 at Carnoustie to his opening 66 at Kingsbarns.Former U.S. Open Champion Graeme McDowell carded a second straight 67 to lie in a big group two shots back alongside  Australian Daniel Gaunt, Scotland's Marc Warren, Austria's Markus Brier and South African Jaco van Zyl.Defending champion Martin Kaymer is looming a shot further back on nine-under, while world number two Lee Westwood and current U.S. Open Champion Rory McIlroy are on seven-under.Top-ranked Luke Donald was challenging until four dropped shots in his last four holes, including a double bogey, put him back to four-under.Donald, who is hoping to become the first man to head the money list on both the PGA and European Tours, drove into the infamous Barry Burn at Carnoustie as his second round unraveled.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "mot": "Fleetwood", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 14, "end": 18,

Friday.Zvonareva will reach a career high No.2 in the rankings if she wins the Toray Pan Pacific title and will face  Agnieszka Radwanska in the final.Polish star Radwanska shocked third seed Victoria Azarenka 6-3 4-6 6-2 in the other semifinal.Ninth seed Radwanska led 6-3 4-2 until Azarenka launched a fight back to win the second set, but two breaks of service saw her home in the decider on her fourth match point.Zvonareva looked in big trouble in the opening stages of her match against Kvitova and faced three set points on her Czech opponent's service until winning it on a tiebreak.The second set was completely one-sided as she breezed into her 30th carrer final.\"I don't even remember being down 5-1 in the first set!\" Zvonareva told the WTA official website.\"But I slowly got into the match, making the shots I usually make. Then I was able to turn it around.\"I think I played very consistently in the second set and Petra started to make a few more mistakes. We had some tough games, but I was able to convert all my chances, and that's why the scoreline looked like that in the end.\"Despite the loss, Kvitova's run to the semifinal will lift her into the top five in the WTA rankings for the first time.Meanwhile, former world number one Maria Sharapova has pulled out of next week's China Open with an ankle injury she picked up in in her quarterfinal against Kvitova.The 24-year-old Russian was force to retire after twisting her ankle, but is hopeful she can return to the circuit before the end of the season.\"Will do my best to recover in time for Istanbul (the season-ending WTA Championships),\" Sharapova said on her website.On the men's ATP Tour, world number four Andy Murray breezed into the semifinals of the Thailand Open in Bangkok.The top seed beat Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-4 in one hour and 28 minutes as he remained on course to win his third title of the season.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 94, "end": 108, "mot": "Vera Zvonareva", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 353, "end": 368, "mot": "Maria Sharapova", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 415, "end": 421, "mot": "Murray", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 480, "end": 494, "mot": "Vera Zvonareva", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 750, "end": 769, "mot": "Agnieszka Radwanska", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 824, "end": 841, "mot": "Victoria Azarenka", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1172, "mot": "Czech", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1899, "mot": "Maria Sharapova", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2299, "mot": "ATP Tour", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2330, "mot": "Andy Murray", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2417, "mot": "Bulgaria", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2435, "mot": "Grigor Dimitrov", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2552, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"player": 9, "tennis_player": 9, "team": 2, "company": 2}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/30/sport/tennis/tennisroundup/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110930030226-zvonareva-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-30T14:59:26Z"}, {"id": "f7625158-e643-5859-819c-6736f7e40d31", "title": "Country profile: Macedonia", "content": "Country profile: MacedoniaBy Catriona Davies and Eoghan Macguire for CNNUpdated 0434 GMT (1234 HKT) September 30, 2011  Photos: Ancient ruins \u2013 The famous mosaics at the ancient Roman archeological site of Stobi, in southeast Macedonia.

Almost two-thirds of the country's population are Orthodox Christians and a third is Muslim, according to the CIA World Factbook.As a result, the country has numerous monasteries, churches and mosques. It also plays host to a number of ancient relics dating back as far as 3,800 years. Lake Ohrid in the south west of the country -- one of the deepest and oldest lakes in Europe -- was once surrounded by 365 churches, some dating as far back as the 4th century.Macedonia lies in a seismically active region and has several hot thermal baths. There are many mountains over 2,500m in the Shar Planina range. The Lonely Planet travel guide describes the country as a \"paradise\" for outdoor types with numerous opportunities for skiing, hiking and climbing.Macedonia was the only country to emerge peacefully from the former Yugoslavia but 20 years later it still has an international identity crisis over its name.Macedonia gained independence from the former Yugoslav federation with overwhelming majority support in a referendum on September 8, 1991. To its own citizens, the country is called the Republic of Macedonia, but both the United Nations and the European Union call it the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia).The reason for the controversy is a region in Greece that is also called Macedonia. International recognition of Macedonia's independence was delayed by Greek objections to the name. Greece eventually agreed to recognize the \"former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" designation.Most Macedonians do not like this name, and negotiations are continuing under the United Nations to find a solution, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.In 2001, there was an uprising of ethnic Albanians -- who make up a quarter of the population -- demanding equal rights, leading to months of violence. Peace returned later the same year with a peacekeeping operation by NATO troops and a new constitution recognizing Albanian as an official language and increasing access for ethnic Albanians to public sector jobs, including the police force.Official statistics show high unemployment at 31.7 percent as of 2010, but this does not take into account the extensive informal job market, estimated to be more than 20 per cent of GDP, according to the CIA World Factbook.Macedonia's current president Gjorgje Ivanov came to power in elections in 2009. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski meanwhile was re-elected in parliamentary elections held in July 2011. His conservative VMRO-DPMNE party now governs in coalition with the ethnic Albanian DUI party.In his victory speech, Ivanov claimed his main priority was seeking further integration and ties with Europe. Macedonia is currently a candidate for membership of the European Union.In September 2011 Macedonia celebrated its 20th anniversary as an independent state.To mark the occasion new monuments, museums, roads and an improved airport terminal were constructed. The centrepiece was the erection of a 24 meter high statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje's Macedonia Square.The monument has caused further friction with neighboring Greece who view the warrior king as a Greek rather than Macedonian national hero.Given that it is still a relatively young country; the number of Macedonians to have left their mark on the world stage is relatively small.Some the most notable include footballer Goran Pandev, who won the European Champions League in 2010 whilst playing for Italian giants Inter Milan, and filmmaker Milco Mancevski, who received an Oscar nomination for his 1995 picture \"Before the Rain.\"Humanitarian and Nobel peace prize winner Mother Teresa was also born in Skopje in 1910, although Macedonia was still part of the Ottoman Empire at this time.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 574, "end": 592, "mot": "CIA World Factbook", "types": ["magazine", "publication"], "type": ["magazine"]}, {"start": 666, "end": 674, "mot":

MunichBayern Munich won Champions League group match 2-0 City turn down approach from West Ham to take Tevez on loanManchester City banned journalists from asking manager Roberto Mancini about striker Carlos Tevez  Friday, as the fallout from the Argentine's apparent refusal to come on as a substitute continued.Tevez, 27, has been suspended pending an investigation by City after Italian manager Mancini claimed the forward refused to come on as a second-half substitute during City's 2-0 European Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich Tuesday.But the 2011 FA Cup winners refused to answer questions on the former Manchester United star during Mancini's press conference ahead of the club's English Premier League clash at Blackburn Rovers Saturday.\"Questions in relation to Carlos Tevez in general, in relation to his alleged conduct on Tuesday evening and the potential ramifications of that conduct and in relation to his future at the football club is strictly off limits and will not

I don't have any complications. \"Only one complication that we had two days ago is that we lost against Bayern Munich, only this.Tevez suspended by Manchester City\"We started very well we can do a fantastic season, I don't have this problem. It is normal that one player is not happy to leave the pitch in an important game or to stay on the bench, it's a normal situation for every manager.\"The defeat to German outfit Bayern was City's first of the season, with the Etihad Stadium outfit still unbeaten and sitting in second position after six games in England's top division.Later Friday, City rejected a request from second-flight West Ham to take Tevez on a temporary loan. Tevez played for the Hammers when he first arrived in English football, helping them to avoid relegation before moving to Manchester United.   In addition to the controversy surrounding Tevez, City's reverse at the Allianz Arena also saw Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko react angrily to being replaced by Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong in the second half.Dzeko, who arrived in Manchester from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg in January, has apologized for his actions and said they were born out of disappointment with his own performance.\"Everyone has had a sleep and a rest after the Bayern game and we know we could have done better but it is football and you cannot win every game,\" Dzeko, who has already scored six Premier League goals this season, told City's official website.\"Bayern Munich is behind us, we are feeling positive and looking forward to the next game. That is our target now.

September 30, 2011 Dmitry Medvedev (R) and Vladimir Putin make a joint appearance at a congress of the United Russia party on September 24.Story highlightsMedvedev says Putin has a better chance of being electedHe says he and Putin belong to \"the same political force\"Putin has suggested Medvedev take over as prime ministerPresident Dmitry Medvedev said Friday he had ceded his presidency bid to the country's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin because the latter is a more popular politician in Russia, who has higher chances to be elected.   \"Prime Minister Putin is definitely  the most authoritative politician in our country and his rating is somewhat higher (than mine),\" Medvedev said in a taped interview with Russia's national TV networks.  Public opinion polls in Russia have invariably indicated that Putin has been ahead of Medvedev in popularity ever since they constructed their ruling tandem almost four years ago. According to the most recent poll, conducted by independent Levada Center, the approval rating of Medvedev stood at 62 per cent in September, compared to Putin's 68 per cent.  In his Friday television interview Medvedev said that he and Putin belong to \"the same political force\" and have \"very close positions on all strategic and tactical issues\" and therefore shouldn't compete or quarrel.   \"Can we possibly imagine, for instance, (U.S. President) Barack Obama competing with (Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton?\" Medvedev asked. \"Both of them were bidding for the presidential nomination ... Both were from the Democratic Party, and (the party) finally decided which of them should run to gain the best election result. Our decision was the same,\" Medvedev said. JUST WATCHEDPutin backed for 2012 presidencyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin backed for 2012 presidency 01:46 \"We want to achieve a political result, to win the elections -- the parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March -- not to be nursing our ambitions,\" Medvedev said.  \"Any responsible person's ambition is to serve his country, and I insist on that,\" he said. Commenting on the statements made by some people that the outcome of the Russian presidential elections is \"predetermined\", Medvedev said, \"I consider such statements absolutely irresponsible, deceitful, and even provocative.\" \"The decisions made at the congress are only recommendations to the party to support two people in the elections, no more than that,\" he said. Last Saturday Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president in 2012. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of their roles.  The announcement ended more than two years of speculation about whether Putin or Medvedev, his hand-picked successor, would seek to run for a second term.   Putin had stepped down as president in 2008 because the Russian constitution at that time limited the office to two consecutive four-year terms. Under amendments to the constitution that came into force on December 31, 2008, the presidential term was extended to six years. This means that if Putin is elected in March 2012 for six years, he would be eligible to run for another six-year term after that, potentially keeping him in charge until 2024.

The Cambridge University study sheds new light on the lives of children and the ancient art they made during the prehistoric hunter gatherer period in the French caverns at Rouffignac, known as the Cave of a Hundred Mammoths.  While the caverns are famous for their striking drawings of woolly mammoths, bison and horses, the research focused on the thousands of lines made by people running their fingers along the soft clay walls throughout the five mile cavern complex. Cambridge archaeologists were able to identify the age and gender of the children who made the simple ancient art form known as \"finger fluting\" by measuring the width of the flutings and the profile of the middle three fingers.  \"We have found marks by children aged between three and seven years old -- and we have been able to identify four individual children by matching up their marks,\" said Cambridge University archaeologist Jess Cooney. \"The most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five -- and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl.\" The fact that archaeologists didn't find a single place where fluting marks were made by adults alone suggests there were few boundaries between adult and child activities in this prehistoric hunter gatherer culture, according to Cooney. Not only did the adults make art alongside the children, Cooney says the fact that child-sized flutings were found on the ceilings of some cave chambers means adults actively encouraged them to make art, lifting them up to areas they could not reach alone. \"Some of the children's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings, so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone's shoulders,\" she said. The archaeologists believe one of the caverns is so dominated by children's flutings that it may actually have been a \"special place\" set aside for them by the adults. \"We sometimes think of one chamber as a playpen of sorts, since there are hundreds of children's flutings but only a few made by adults,\" said Cooney. Why people made finger flutings, which also appear in caves in Spain, New Guinea and Australia, is anyone's guess. \"We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day,\" said Cooney. The children weren't simply running their hands mindlessly along the cavern walls, however. Research in 2006 revealed children had made hut-like shapes called tectiforms -- the first known instance of prehistoric children engaging in symbolic figure-making, according to Cooney.  Cooney says her research shines a light on an aspect of history that is typically ignored in academia. \"It's important to realize that children played a major role in the development of not only art, but what it means to be human,\" she said.

They've murdered. And they have killed for nothing. And for this they must be condemned to the maximum sentence,\" Manuela Comodi said.But Knox's attorney, Maria Del Grosso, said her client is the victim of bad casting in a script in which prosecutors have decided she is guilty, \"regardless of the logic and reason.\"For the convictions to stand, Del Grosso argued, prosecutors need, \"proofs, proofs, proofs, and in this case there is only the proof that they are strangers to this crime.\"No ruling is expected until Monday, when Knox and Sollecito are expected to give final statements, according to the judge.JUST WATCHEDExclusive look at Knox behind barsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExclusive look at Knox behind bars 03:42JUST WATCHEDPhotos show Amanda Knox in prison ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPhotos show Amanda Knox in prison  01:50JUST WATCHEDCovering the Amanda Knox caseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCovering the Amanda Knox case 01:40JUST WATCHEDWhat do Perugians think of Knox trial?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat do Perugians think of Knox trial? 02:17Knox's father, Curt Knox, said he is hopeful his daughter will be able to return home soon.\"It has been a very hard journey and hopefully we're near the end of it,\" he said.Prosecutors claim Knox slashed Kercher's throat as Sollecito and a third defendant, Rudy Guede, held her down.Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. Guede was convicted in a separate trial and is serving 16 years.Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Guede could have been the sole killer and argue the police investigation was shoddy and incomplete.Del Grosso said there was no evidence of a cover-up attempt, as prosecutors claim, and accused prosecutors of using a double standard when it comes to evidence in the case.Sollecito's lawyer, Donatella Donati, told the court that her team suffered repeated roadblocks each time they asked for further reviews of the evidence and said it was clear that some of the evidence had been contaminated.On Thursday, defense attorneys argued Knox had been denied a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer when she was arrested, and portrayed her as a young girl, inexperienced with world travel and unable to speak Italian.Knox's attorneys also argued for the exclusion of some DNA evidence in the case, including evidence of blood that prosecutors said belonged to both women found in a bathroom they shared and evidence from the knife, which Knox attorney Carlo Dalla Vedova on Thursday called a \"concentration of nothingness, a fantasy.\"Friday morning, prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said Knox and Sollecito tried to blame the killing on Guede because Guede is black. Comodi showed jurors a photograph of a bloody footprint found in the bathroom of the home were Kercher was killed. There was no way the footprint was Guede's as defense attorneys had contended, Comodi argued. She said experts have concluded that the footprint was not Guede's and probably was Sollecito's.She also told the court that just because the footprint was found \"not usable\" for positive identification, it doesn't mean that they are \"non usable'\" when you can do a process of elimination.Comodi also used her microphone to demonstrate how the location where Knox's DNA was found on the presumed murder weapon -- at the junction between the blade and the handle -- suggests a stabbing motion, rather than a cutting motion.Also Friday, Carlo Pacelli, the attorney for Patrick Lumumba -- who was initially accused in the case -- called Knox a \"mixed concentration of sex, drugs and alcohol\"  who, despite the portrait painted by defense attorneys, was a \"diabolical defamer.\"Lumumba, the former owner of a bar where Knox worked, sued Knox for libel. In the Italian court system, criminal and civil portions of a case are heard in the same proceeding.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 26, "end": 30, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister",

They were tired of seeing their daughter's name plastered across newspapers around the world with the word murderer alongside it.But the ticket was never used.  In December 2009, that ticket got shredded along with some of the hope her family was clinging to as she was hauled away as a convicted murderer from an Italian court.Now, as closing arguments in Amanda Knox's appeal come to an end, one thing remains the same for the Knox parents: A plane ticket home.

Hope pumped through their veins: a hope that an Italian court would see that their daughter was not a murderer.They were fighting a legal battle in which the odds were stacked unfairly against their daughter, according to many in Knox's camp.They were also fighting to preserve their daughter's image by countering what they felt was an unfair media caricature of their daughter as \"Foxy Knoxy.\" The nickname, her parents said, was given to her in school because of her soccer skills, but during the murder trial it became a nickname to portray her as a careless, sex-crazed party girl. Her family told the story of an entirely different Amanda Knox: one who was \"nonviolent\" and \"almost a passive person.\"Amanda Knox: From Seattle to ItalyProsecutors alleged at trial that on the night of November 1, 2007, at a small house in the college town of Perugia, Knox directed her then-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and a third defendant Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. They said the trio left her in a pool of blood and covered her with her own blanket.Knox's parents, like her defense attorneys, said their daughter was not involved in the murder and that evidence presented at trial was thin and clouded by shoddy police work. But at the trial, those arguments fell on deaf ears. Knox was convicted along with Sollecito in the murder of Kercher and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively.Guede was convicted in a separate fast-track trial and is serving 16 years in prison. Now, two years after Knox's conviction, Knox's parents are fighting a similar battle during her appeal.Finding 'the truth' of what happened in PerugiaInside the same Italian courtroom where Knox and Sollecito were convicted and sentenced, they now fight to try and prove the court got it all wrong.The dispute over forensic evidence has prompted many Knox supporters to question how the Italian court arrived at a conviction.  Gallery: A look at the evidence\"From what we have heard (about) first trials here in Italy, a lot of it is related to emotion,\" Curt Knox told CNN earlier this month.And he, like many in the Knox camp, wonders why more wasn't done to clarify facts about the evidence at trial in order to avoid his daughter being convicted and imprisoned for two years and 24 more to go.\"When you look at the actual forensic evidence (from the murder trial) -- when you take a look at what the police were saying, which is literally 180 degrees different than what the defense was saying about the forensic evidence, and not have an independent review during the first trial, you can see how the result came out as is,\" he said.Disputed evidence at the heart of appealAttorneys for Knox and Sollecito, are appealing their convictions together since they were tried and convicted together.  Timeline of the Knox caseAn independent forensic investigation they fought for at trial could help overturn the convictions in the appeal, the attorneys said. During the murder trial, defense attorneys challenged key DNA evidence found on the alleged murder weapon, a knife, and on Kercher's bra clasp, arguing it had been contaminated after being left for weeks at the crime scene.. They asked for an independent examination of the evidence, but it was denied.JUST WATCHEDPhotos show Amanda Knox in prison ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPhotos show Amanda Knox in prison  01:50JUST WATCHEDWhat do Perugians think of Knox trial?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat do Perugians think of Knox trial? 02:17JUST WATCHEDKnox's dad: 'There is no case left'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKnox's dad: 'There is no case left' 02:22JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox appeal in final stretchReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox appeal in final stretch 04:50During the appeals process the independent examination was allowed and has become the central issue of the appeal.At trial in 2009 prosecutors said there were traces of Knox's genetic material on the knife handle and traces of Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. That DNA was used to tie Knox to the crime scene during the murder trial, though defense attorneys argued there was barely enough DNA to get an accurate reading.During the appeal, one of the independent forensic experts who studied the original evidence told the court that the DNA alleged to be Kercher's that was on the knife could not have been from blood. That key statement has led to a defense argument that there is now truly no official evidence that links Knox to the scene.The next battle in the appeal was to dismiss evidence that prosecutors said ties Sollecito to the murder scene.At trial, the prosecution said a bra clasp found on the bloodied crime scene floor had Sollecito's DNA on it and proved he was in Kercher's room when the murder occurred. Defense attorneys argued the bra clasp had been left on the floor for nearly six weeks before it was collected and was likely contaminated.In the appeal, two independent forensic experts argued Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be \"inadmissible\" because the clasp had not been properly handled. Prosecutors dismissed the theory again during the appeal, specifying it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene. They said documents showed that proper checks were carried out before and after their DNA tests to verify the quality of the work. But the appeals judge couldn't find the documents in court records and ruled they would not be admissible.The appeals judge denied prosecution efforts to introduce newly found records about the original testing and to hear a new witness -- all victories for Knox's defense, which opposed the motions.Curt Knox said he feels there is \"no case left\" against his daughter. And that's something he said his daughter is clinging to.Will Knox return to prison -- or back home to Seattle?The DNA evidence is the primary subject of closing arguments on both sides of the appeal.Prosecutor Manuela Comodi refuted the testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence, insisting police forensic officers had handled the DNA material properly. She cast doubt on one of the expert who was a professor, rather than a professional in the field and said police had better experience when it came to processing the crime scene than an independent expert.The review had been \"embarrassing, inappropriate, and presented in a hostile way\" and was not based on science, she said.Before asking the jurors to uphold the conviction she told them that the original court had concluded \"beyond any reasonable doubt\" that blood from both Knox and Kercher found in the bathroom sink had been left there when Knox washed herself after the killing.Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who investigated the original murder and defended the prosecution's case in the appeal, urged the jurors to make their decision on the basis of what they had heard in court, not in the overwhelming media coverage.But Knox and Sollecito's defense teams are arguing the whole trial was based on DNA evidence \"on which mistakes were made,\" and urged the jury to \"abandon imagined fantasies\" and acquit the pair.Sollecito's defense lawyer Giulia Bongiorno also said during closing arguments to remember that the true evidence points to who they believe is the sole killer: Rudy Guede. Guede, who was convicted earlier of the crime, has admitted being in the villa where Kercher was killed, but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room during his trial. He later implicated Knox and Sollecito. During his trial prosecutors introduced evidence that showed Guede's handprint in Kercher's blood was found in the room along with his DNA inside her body as well as on her clothing and on her purse.\"The room speaks only of Rudy,\" Bongiorno said during closing arguments.Bongiorno also attacked the media portrayal of Knox as a \"femme fatale,\" which he said swayed the outcome of the trial.Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the court had already seen \"there is not trace of Amanda Knox in the room where murder took place.\"He told the jury based on the evidence \"that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving Amanda Knox.\"Speculation is rampant as to whether defense attorneys have cast doubt on the evidence that sent Sollecito and Knox to prison for murder.Even the prosecutor's office told CNN that its attorneys are less certain of the outcome this time. The prosecution is still confident that the verdict will be upheld, but is aware that it could go either way, the office said.Curt Knox is more hopeful.\"It really appears to me that they want to find the truth,\" he said during the appeal. \"I'm very hopeful that by the end of the month, we'll be able to bring Amanda and Rafaelle home.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/30/world/europe/knox-court-saga/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110924093339-amanda-knox-court-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-30T11:42:37Z"}, {"id": "89d851e5-211d-5cb8-bbae-fbb5e51b10d5", "title": "Spurs lucky to survive Shamrock scare", "content": "Spurs lucky to survive Shamrock scareBy Updated 0933 GMT (1733 HKT) September 30, 2011 Spurs striker Roman Pavyluchenko equalized for the English Premier League side.Story highlightsTottenham Hotspur beat Irish champions Shamrock Rovers 3-1 in the Europa LeagueSpurs had gone behind to the part-timersElsewhere Celtic drew 1-1 with Italy's UdineseBig-spending PSG lost 2-0 to struggling Athletic BilbaoEnglish Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur eased past Irish champions Shamrock Rovers in their Europa League Group A match, but only after surviving a massive scare against the part-timers.Despite dominating first half possession, Spurs found Rovers goalkeeper Richard Brush in fine form and pulled off a string of stunning saves including one point-blank effort against England international Jermain Defoe. Yet it was Shamrock Rovers -- whose total yearly budget is just 600,000 euros ($815,000), equivalent to a month's wages for one of Tottenham's top stars -- who took the lead early in the second half in front of their boisterous support when Pat Sullivan's stinging shot was deflected in by Stephen Rice.Suddenly Spurs, who had rested many of their first team players, were forced to find an answer to Rovers' impudence.And it came in brutal fashion.Stung into action Spurs scored three goals in six minutes; Roman Pavyluchenko, Jermain Defoe and Giovani dos Santos extinguishing any hopes of a fairytale ending. Elsewhere Serie A side Udinese had to rely on a late, controversial penalty to grab an away draw against Scotland's Celtic in Group I.The Glasgow club had taken a first half lead through their own penalty, scored by South Korean striker Ki Sung-Yeung before Almen Abdi leveled from the spot late on. But the match of the round, on paper at least, took place in Group F in the Basque country as Athletic Bilbao, struggling in Spain's La Liga, took on big-spending Paris Saint Germain. PSG, who were taken over by a Qatari consortium in the summer, had been in good form going into the match but Bilbao coach Marco Bielsa masterminded a shock 2-0 victory.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 146, "end": 160, "mot": "Premier League", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 221, "end": 236, "mot": "Shamrock Rovers", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 248, "end": 254, "mot": "Europa", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 311, "end": 317, "mot": "Celtic", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 332, "end": 337, "mot": "Italy", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 360, "end": 363, "mot": "PSG", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 410, "end": 424, "mot": "Premier League", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 430, "end": 447, "mot": "Tottenham Hotspur", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 475, "end": 490, "mot": "Shamrock Rovers", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 666, "end": 679, "mot": "Richard Brush", "types": ["goalkeeper"], "type": []}, {"start": 776, "end": 783, "mot": "England", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 798, "end": 811, "mot": "Jermain Defoe", "types": ["forward"], "type": []}, {"start": 824, "end": 839, "mot": "Shamrock Rovers", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 944, "end": 953, "mot": "Tottenham", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1066, "mot": "Pat Sullivan", "types": ["coach", "football_player", "football_coach"], "type": ["coach"]}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1354, "mot": "Jermain Defoe", "types": ["forward"], "type": []}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1377, "mot": "Giovani dos Santos", "types": ["player"], "type": []}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1442, "mot": "Serie A", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1455, "mot": "Udinese", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1538, "mot": "Scotland", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1547, "mot": "Celtic", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1570, "mot": "Glasgow", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1675, "mot": "Ki Sung-Yeung", "types": ["player"], "type": []}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1693, "mot": "Almen Abdi", "types": ["player"], "type": []}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1834, "mot": "Athletic Bilbao", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1855, "mot": "Spain", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1865, "mot": "La Liga", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1907, "mot": "Paris Saint Germain", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1912, "mot": "PSG", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2097, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"association": 7, "team": 10, "club": 3, "company": 6, "goalkeeper": 1, "forward": 2, "coach": 1, "football_player": 1, "football_coach": 1, "player": 3}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/29/sport/football/football-spurs-shamrock-europa/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110929091759-football-europa-spurs-roman-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-29T21:25:45Z"}, {"id": "98a9b634-6ab1-5e0c-9318-b3f95e4be7cd", "title": "Amanda Knox lawyers make final arguments", "content": "Amanda Knox lawyers make final argumentsBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1731 GMT (0131 HKT) September 29, 2011 JUST WATCHEDFinal arguments in Amanda Knox appealReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFinal arguments in Amanda Knox appeal 02:21Story highlights A lawyer for Knox says she \"is very afraid but her heart is full of hope\"Another lawyer urges the jury to absolve Knox as he wraps up his closing argument A verdict in the appeal will not come before Monday, the judge saysKnox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing Briton Meredith KercherA lawyer for Amanda Knox said Thursday the only option for the jury considering her murder appeal in Italy is to clear her of guilt.

Rather, \"they are parents and they deserve respect.\" The lawyer also praised the court's work, saying he felt Knox's rights had finally been respected.Urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail, Vedova earlier detailed what he called many \"mistakes\" made in the investigation into Kercher's death.When Knox was arrested and interrogated, she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer, Vedova said.\"'That night  Amanda Knox's right to defend herself was denied,\" he said. \"She was just a young girl, first time out of the country. She didn't speak Italian.\"Vedova argued that some of the DNA evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out.He said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police, including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls. The prosecution's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong, he said.As for the knife used to kill Kercher, a key piece of evidence, Vedova told the court there was a \"concentration of nothingness, a fantasy\" in the prosecution's arguments.He ridiculed a theory that Sollecito had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing, asking: \"What kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder?\"Vedova claimed forensics experts who examined computers belonging to Knox and Sollecito had destroyed the machines and with them evidence that was certain to be favorable to the defendants.This included photographs of Knox and Kercher together that demonstrated they were friends, he said.Showing the court panoramic pictures of the villa Knox shared with Kercher, Vedova rejected the prosecution claim that a fake robbery had been staged by someone inside the house to try to cover up what had happened.He also suggested the original court had taken sides over some of the evidence, choosing to accept as credible some witnesses whose testimony went against Knox and rejecting others who were in her favor.Knox's attorneys' statements follow arguments presented this week by the lawyer of her co-defendant.Lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said Tuesday that Knox is not the character the media has painted her to be, and urged a jury to acquit Knox and Sollecito of murdering Kercher.Bongiorno compared Knox to the voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, who protests, \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way,\" in the movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" Bongiorno said the whole trial was based on DNA evidence \"on which mistakes were made,\" and urged the jury to \"abandon imagined fantasies\" and acquit the pair.Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. In her closing arguments, Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered.\"The room speaks only of Rudy\" Guede, the other man convicted separately of killing Kercher, Bongiorno told the jury.Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Guede, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for the murder, could have been the sole killer.Evidence that Guede was in the room shows that \"no one could enter that room and not leave any trace,\" Bongiorno said. And she hammered home attacks on DNA evidence that has been a key part of the appeal.

Expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility -- Europe's bailout fund -- so it can increase its lending capacity from around \u20ac250 billion to \u20ac440 billion must be ratified by a number of European countries.Germany's parliamentary approval follows votes in favor this week from Austria and Finland.But the vote in Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, was seen as particularly crucial because it is the eurozone's biggest economy, and its Chancellor Angela Merkel is a key figure in attempts to pull the bloc out of its crisis.The bailout fund is being increased after the initial fund, which was put in place after Greece's \u20ac110 billion bail out last May, was tapped by Ireland and Portugal, before Greece returned for more help.The original fund was meant to stem the crisis but this has not happened. Instead, the crisis has intensified, feeding global instability and driving the eurozone to the edge of recession.The new powers will allow the fund also to buy sovereign bonds in the capital markets, a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 58, "end": 61, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 137, "end": 150, "mot": "Angela Merkel", "types": ["politician", "president", "chemist"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 180, "end": 197, "mot": "Wolfgang Schauble", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 527, "end": 533, "mot": "Europe", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 553, "end": 559, "mot": "Greece", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 772, "end": 809, "mot": "European Financial Stability Facility", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 813, "end": 819, "mot": "Europe", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1188, "mot": "eurozone", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1240, "mot": "Angela Merkel", "types": ["politician", "president", "chemist"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1399, "mot": "Greece", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1483, "mot": "Greece", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1669, "mot": "eurozone", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1853, "mot": "eurozone", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1899, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 2, "politician": 3, "president": 2, "chemist": 2, "union": 6, "force": 3}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/29/world/europe/germany-europe-bailout/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110929012131-germany-merkel-schaeuble-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-29T10:44:21Z"}, {"id": "6b9072fd-0ba0-5d0f-b5e9-767101e925a4", "title": " Sharapova, Djokovic hit by injury", "content": " Sharapova, Djokovic hit by injuryBy Updated 1842 GMT (0242 HKT) September 29, 2011 World number two Maria Sharapova pulls out of the Pan Pacific Open after injuring her ankleStory highlightsMaria Sharapova pulls out of the Pan Pacific Open in Japan after twisting her ankleShe was losing 4-3 in the first set of her quarterfinal match against Petra KvitovaWorld number one Novak Djokovic also announced he was pulling out of the China Open due to injuryPlayers had threatened a strike due to tournament 'burn out'World number two Maria Sharapova limped out of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo after twisting her ankle during her quarterfinal match against Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic.Sharapova had hoped for revenge after the Kvitova beat her in the final at Wimbledon this year.But with Sharapova losing 4-3 in the first set the Russian fell and retired shortly after.\"I hit a serve and then landed awkwardly on my left ankle.

In March 2013, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the pair's acquittals, saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered.JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox's fate rests again with Italian courtReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox's fate rests again with Italian court 02:33The case was sent to a retrial in Florence, which began in September 2013 and concluded in January 2014 with another conviction for murder for Knox and Sollecito.

When Knox made the media rounds to promote her memoir in May 2013, Kercher's sister said the family was not interested in reading the book.\"We are not interested in this book just like so many others about the case and we will not read it,\" Stephanie Kercher said in a statement. \"I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life. Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her. Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.\"Despite the focus on Knox's endless travails, Kercher's family and friends remain determined to keep her memory alive.\"I want people to remember Meredith for the good times she had in Perugia, not just the horrible ending,\" said Natalie Hayward, who got to know Kercher before her death.\"She was very generous and open and had a very big heart. She was a very fulfilled human being. She was happy and talked about her family all the time. She had lived life to the full. That gives me a great deal of comfort.\"Kercher was just 21 when she was killed in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Her body was found semi-naked and her throat had been slashed.Kercher was a third-year student at the University of Leeds focusing on European Studies when she got the chance to live in Perugia for a year to study European Politics and Italian.She worked at Gatwick Airport, near her home in Coulsdon, a dormitory town south of London, to raise money for the trip. Her father John told the Daily Telegraph: \"She fought so hard to get out there. There were quite a few setbacks but she was determined to go and kept persisting and eventually got what she wanted.\"I've no doubt that the other side also has a story of pain and loss and utter disbelief but in the end it is also one of hope and a chance to live life; something Meredith will never haveStephanie KercherHer family later described how she was \"excited at the prospect of spending the year studying there to improve her language skills, make new friends and immerse herself in the culture. She was pursuing her dream.\"She moved into a shared apartment with Knox but tensions mounted between the two young women, according to Hayward, who met Kercher in September 2007. Hayward told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011 that Kercher, known to her friends as \"Mez,\" became \"frustrated\" by Knox's refusal to do cleaning and was unhappy that her flatmate kept a sex toy on open display in a bathroom cabinet.Kercher, the youngest of four children, had a good sense of humor, according to her family, and \"a sense of the ridiculous.\" While growing up she was interested in poetry, gymnastics and ballet.Her India-born mother Arline gave an interview to Italian television show Porta a Porta in September 2011 in which she described Meredith's love of life. She said her daughter was a \"very loving child, a very sweet girl.\" She said: \"She was always ready to help you. I will never, ever forget her.\"Her father, a freelance journalist who wrote a book about his daughter -- \"Meredith\" -- described her as a \"beautiful, intelligent and caring girl whom everyone loved\" in a story for the Daily Mail newspaper, before the book's release.\"I hope our telling the world about the enchanting, generous, kind person that Meredith was can help those whose lives she touched,\" he wrote. \"I also hope this book might help to keep Meredith's case in the spotlight, and, in some small way, to keep alive the hope that we might yet know the truth about her death.\"John Kercher wrote about the moment he learned the British student killed in Perugia was his daughter. He'd spoken to her the day before. \"I drop the phone,\" he wrote in Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper. \"I don't believe it and think there must be a mistake. But I know it's probably true. I can't cry. I'm numb with shock.\"He also told about hearing that some of Meredith's friends planned to lay flowers at her old school after her death.Expecting just a few, he and Arline arrived to find more than 70 people, some having come from around the country. \"It's unbelievably touching,\" John Kercher recalled. A trust fund had been set up to support the Kercher family's fight for justice. \"Meredith is not only a terrible loss to her family and friends, she is also a huge loss to the world,\" he said.Richard Ottaway, the member of parliament for Coulsden, was taken aback by Meredith's funeral at Croydon Minster. \"It was packed and overflowing,\" he told CNN. \"It was quite clear Meredith was a popular girl ... so many friends there.

However, as it stands, it is uncertain whether this will happen.Francesco Maresca, the Kercher family lawyer, said: \"The interest of the family is to arrive to the end of this trial.

Five of the six top ranked players in the world -- Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy,  America's Dustin Johnson and defending champion Kaymer -- will challenge for a share of the $5m prize pot.   This year, amateurs making a star turn include former Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff, cricketer Shane Warne from Australia and Hollywood greats Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas.\"It does not get better than this.

Many, including Martin Kaymer, Ernie Els and Rory McIlroy,  have chosen more familiar faces, to them at least, and will tee off with their fathers.  But the prize for most unexpected and welcome visitor of the week goes to...the sun.

is developing.The army already has more of the weapons than it requires, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Nikolai Makarov told Russian media.The inventor of the weapon, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 91, has reportedly been deliberately kept uninformed about the decision.\"We do not want to have it on our conscience and tell him such bad news. He might not live through it,\" Russia's Izvestia newspaper quoted an unnamed friend of Kalashnikov as saying. The legendary weapon, known for its simplicity of operation and maintenance and reliability in extreme conditions -- be they hot, cold, wet or sandy -- has been the weapon of choice for national armies and paramilitary guerrillas alike.JUST WATCHED2009: What's killing the Kalashnikov?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2009: What's killing the Kalashnikov? 00:59Instantly recognizable by its banana-shaped ammunition magazine, the weapon, also known as the AK-47, was invented in 1947 -- AK being a Russian acronym for \"Kalashnikov's machine gun,\" and 47 standing for the year it was invented.The AK-47, along with its various modifications, has been recognized in the Guinness World Records book as being the world's most common machine gun. Licensed and unlicensed versions of the rifle are manufactured in several countries.According to the weapon's manufacturer Izhmash, the rifle is still adopted by armed and special forces in over 100 countries.The weapon was so instrumental in Mozambique's successful rebel movement that its image was incorporated into the national flag. It is also depicted as part of Zimbabwe's coat of arms.In 2009, Kalashnikov told a CNN crew on an excursion to the Izhmash arms assembly plant in the Russian city of Izhevsk that two main qualities describe his machine gun: simplicity and reliability.\"It is a thousand times harder to make simple things than complicated ones,\" he said. \"It is very important because a soldier doesn't have university degrees. He needs a simple and reliable weapon. Just as an academic, for that matter, in a combat situation. There's simply no time to figure how to operate a complicated weapon and press many buttons when the enemy is advancing on you.\"When Kalashnikov turned 90 in 2009, the day was celebrated in Russia on a scale akin to a national holiday. He was decorated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev with the country's highest order, the Hero of Russia.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 26, "end": 37, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 47, "end": 58, "mot": "Greg Hughes", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 124, "end": 129, "mot": "AK-47", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 131, "end": 150, "mot": "Mikhail Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 165, "end": 170, "mot": "AK-74", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 280, "end": 292, "mot": "Kalashnikovs", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 415, "end": 426, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 803, "end": 818, "mot": "Nikolai Makarov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 866, "end": 885, "mot": "Mikhail Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1080, "mot": "Izvestia", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1130, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1426, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1494, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1601, "mot": "AK-47", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1629, "mot": "AK", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1670, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1741, "mot": "AK-47", "types": ["instrument"], "type": []}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1816, "mot": "Guinness", "types": ["book", "publication"], "type": ["book"]}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2012, "mot": "Izhmash", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2068, "mot": "special forces", "types": ["army"], "type": []}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2295, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2306, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2342, "mot": "Izhmash", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2863, "end": 2874, "mot": "Kalashnikov", "types": ["general"], "type": []}, {"start": 3004, "end": 3019, "mot": "Dmitry Medvedev", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3092, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"general": 11, "politician": 2, "instrument": 6, "newspaper": 1, "book": 1, "publication": 1, "company": 4, "army": 1, "president": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/29/world/europe/russia-kalashnikov/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110929050641-russia-kalashnikov-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-29T07:10:28Z"}, {"id": "317acfcf-0aa2-5fd5-be54-73f1714a8262", "title": "Strauss-Kahn and sex assault accuser questioned in Paris", "content": "Strauss-Kahn and sex assault accuser questioned in ParisBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1333 GMT (2133 HKT) September 29, 2011 Dominique Strauss-Kahn leaves the financial crimes unit in Paris after meeting with his accuser Tristane Banon.Story highlightsWriter Tristane Banon alleges that Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted her in Paris in 2003He has said her version of events is \"imaginary\"Police will pass a report based on their questioning to a judgeSexual assault charges filed against Strauss-Kahn in New York were dropped last month Ex-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the French woman who has accused him of attempted rape, Tristane Banon, appeared before police in Paris Thursday.During the two-and-a-half-hour session, termed a confrontation in France, the two parties were asked questions by police without lawyers present.The police will now file a report, which will be turned over to a judge.

In December 2009, they were convicted, though lawyers for both suggested the crime was carried out solely by a third man, Rudy Guede, who was convicted in a separate trial.There's dispute about the evidence linking him to the murder. Prosecutors say his DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Kercher, while the defense says there is too little genetic material for a positive ID and that the clasp could have been contaminated by police handling.His alibi proved impossible to verify -- he says he was at home on the night of the killing, but his computer showed no activity during the time Kercher was killed.In the end, the jury sided with the prosecutors, sentencing him to 25 years in prison for the murder and related crimes. (Knox got an extra year because she was also found guilty of defaming bar owner Patrick Lumumba by accusing him of the killing.)JUST WATCHEDKnox trial explainedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKnox trial explained 02:52JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox appeal drawing to closeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox appeal drawing to close 03:27It was not the result Sollecito was expecting.\"When the sentencing was read, I didn't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still I don't understand why I was convicted,\" he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing.He continues to believe he has a future outside prison, he said.\"Otherwise, I would go insane. I think especially about studying and obtaining a post-graduate degree,\" he said.He has finished his computer science degree in prison, according to press reports. Sollecito was not studying at the same university as Knox, and is not being held in the same prison.He said it is difficult to remain hopeful.\"The world has collapsed on top of me with this verdict. It collapsed on me and Amanda,\" he said. He denied that he is still in love with her.\"But I feel close to her because I consider her my companion in misadventure,\" he said.He rejected the idea that Knox is capable of murder.\"I don't even dare think a thing like that. It is absurd and inadmissible. She is a very sweet girl,\" he insisted.As their joint appeal came to a close this month, his lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, rejected media portrayals of Sollecito as a patsy who fell into the clutches of a femme fatale, Knox.\"The lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed. You must today evaluate if -- if -- if these kids committed the crime,\" Bongiorno told jurors.Sollecito may well head for home if the jury decides in his favor.Sollecito is from Bari, on the Adriatic coast, far south of the central Italian university town where he was studying, and in his prison interview he said he misses the smell of the sea.\"Above all my family,\" he said in the interview conducted via attorney Luca Maori. \"I also miss my friends, the everyday life, the walks in my town's square. And I very much miss the smell of the sea.\"If he does go home to Bari, he hopes simply to blend in, he said.\"I only hope to be forgotten; the sooner the better.

George Wright, who escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1970, could stay in Portugal awhile.Then, on July 31, 1972, Wright and four other members of the Black Liberation Army went to the Detroit airport and hijacked Delta Flight 841 for Miami. Wright was dressed as a priest and carried a handgun in a hollowed-out Bible.Once on the ground, the hijackers demanded $1 million be delivered to the plane by FBI agents wearing nothing more than bathing suits -- an attempt to ensure that the agents were not armed. The FBI complied.Wright fled to Algeria and disappeared from sight. It's not clear how he ended up in Portugal.He is fighting extradition, a U.S. federal agent said, and his next court appearance in Portugal is in about two weeks.The Portuguese lawyer, who did not want to be identified, said Portugal has strong extradition agreements with European Union countries but any situation involving the United States could be more complex.

Knox, her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and a drifter named Rudy Guede were tried for murder.Here is a timeline of key events from the case:November 2, 2007Meredith Kercher is found dead in the house in Perugia, Italy, that she shared with Amanda Knox. Police say her body is partially clothed, with her throat cut.November 5, 2007Read MoreKnox and Raffaele Sollecito are detained for questioning. Knox allegedly confesses to being at her home when Kercher was killed and implicates Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she worked. Lumumba also is detained. November 20, 2007Lumumba is released after two weeks in prison when his alibi is corroborated. He spent the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub in Perugia, police say. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages.November 22, 2007The text of a note Knox wrote on November 6, while in police custody, is published by CNN and other media outlets. Knox addresses an alleged confession, saying: \"In regards to this 'confession' that I made last night, I want to make clear that I'm very doubtful of the verity of my statements because they were made under the pressures of stress, shock and extreme exhaustion. Not only was I told I would be arrested and put in jail for 30 years, but I was also hit in the head when I didn't remember a fact correctly.\"December 2007After being caught without a train ticket in Germany, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, is extradited to Italy. A vaginal swab taken from Kercher matches DNA from Guede. Guede admits to police that he had sexual relations with Kercher but says another man killed her while he was in the bathroom.July 11, 2008Italian prosecutors formally charge Knox, Guede and Sollecito with murder.September 6, 2008Rudy Guede asks for a separate fast-track trial, fearing that Knox and Sollecito had formed a pact against him. His defense attorney says, \"In recent weeks a lot of poison has been spread by the defense teams, and we feel the necessity to find some form of serenity in a separate hearing.\"October 28, 2008Knox and Sollecito are indicted on murder charges. Guede is found guilty of murder in his fast-track trial and sentenced to 30 years. (The sentence is reduced to 16 years on appeal in December 2009.)January 16, 2009Knox and Sollecito's murder trial begins. Reporters from all over the world attend, and some sit at the defense table because of limited space in the courtroom.June 12, 2009Knox testifies that during police interrogations she was confused and that interrogators pressured her, called her a \"stupid liar\" and hit her in the head. Officials have denied beating Knox. She also says some of her actions that made her look bad when described by the press were taken the wrong way. She adds that she was in shock after the murder, and that caused her strange behavior.September 27, 2009Final witnesses are heard in the trial.December 4, 2009The jury finds Knox and Sollecito guilty on all counts in the stabbing death of  Kercher. Knox gets a 26-year sentence; Sollecito gets 25 years. June 1, 2010Knox appears briefly in Italian court to face slander charges for saying that Italian police beat her during an interrogation. She said police used the threat of physical violence to intimidate and pressure her, which led her to falsely accuse Lumumba of Kercher's murder, but officials deny these allegations.The case officially goes to trial in November.November 24, 2010Knox and Sollecito's murder appeal process begins. The hearing lasts about 15 minutes before the judge adjourns until December 11 because one of the lawyers is not present. Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga tells reporters that rather than prosecutors having to prove she is guilty, \"we have to prove her innocence, which is more difficult to do.\"December 11, 2010Knox speaks for about 15 minutes and breaks down in tears. She says that she and Sollecito are innocent and unjustly accused. \"I've been condemned for the crime I did not commit,\" Knox says, adding that the court has made \"a huge mistake.\"January 22, 2011Two forensic experts from Rome's La Sapienza University are sworn in and will retest crucial forensic evidence used to convict Knox. They will take a second look at a knife and clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her murder. Results from the tests are expected in May. February 15, 2011Knox's parents are indicted for allegedly libeling police in Perugia, Knox's mother and the family's attorney say. Curt Knox and Edda Mellas are accused of defaming the police in comments to the Sunday Times of London in a 2009 interview. A hearing in the case is set for July 4.May 21, 2011A jury of two judges and six citizens is scheduled to hear Knox's appeal starting in late May.  June 18, 2011Two prison inmates testify during Knox's appeal that the American student was not actually involved in the killing of her roommate. But they offer two different accounts on who the actual killers were. Prosecutors say they doubt the credibility of the witnesses.June 27, 2011Guede refuses to say during testimony that Knox was not involved in the murder. The prosecutor reads a letter saying Guede thought Knox and Sollecito had killed Kercher.Defense attorneys argue that Guede's letter was based on \"a feeling\" and that his accusations are not based on facts or events he witnessed. Knox takes the stand for emotional testimony after Guede speaks, saying she is \"shocked\" at what he said.\"The only time that Rudy Guede, Raffaele Sollecito and I were in one room together was in a courtroom. ... He knows what the truth is. I don't know what happened that night,\" she says.June 29, 2011Forensic specialists tell the court that DNA evidence linking Knox to the alleged murder weapon is unsound, giving a boost to her appeal. Specialists say that while they agree Knox's DNA was present on the knife handle, tests for Kercher's DNA were unreliable. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned.The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. Defense lawyers say the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra may have been contaminated because it was not collected as evidence until nearly six weeks after the killing. Prosecutors had said there was DNA from Raffaele Sollecito on the clasp.July 4, 2011The judge in the libel case against Knox's parents resigns because he was involved in the trial of Knox and Sollecito. Paolo Micheli says he will recuse himself. July 25, 2011Court-appointed experts testify that police forensic scientists involved in the murder case made a series of glaring errors during their investigation. In a point-by-point deconstruction, the experts say that because of the errors made by police during the original investigation, the evidence against Knox and Sollecito should be considered \"inadmissible.\"September 5, 2011Prosecutors fighting to keep Knox behind bars defend the DNA tests. As the appeal nears its end, Kercher's sister urges people not to get caught up in the details but to \"please remember our beautiful Meredith.\"September 6, 2011Italian state police forensic expert Patrizia Stefanoni defends the methods and equipment used in DNA tests for the investigation. She says the machine used for the DNA examination was clean and rejects suggestions that Kercher's bra clasp had been contaminated. September 7, 2011Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman rejects a prosecution request for new DNA testing. He also turns down prosecution requests to introduce newly found records about the DNA tests and to hear a new witness. Knox's father, Curt, hails the rulings as \"very good news for Amanda.\" The hearing is adjourned until September 23.September 23, 2011Prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola begins final arguments by urging jurors to put themselves in the shoes of the parents of Meredith Kercher, \"a serious, studious girl whose life was taken away by these two kids from good families.\" Another prosecutor, Giuliano Mignini, questions why defense lawyers did not raise concerns about how evidence was collected during the original trial.September 24, 2011Prosecutor Manuela Comodi wraps up the prosecution summary by attacking the independent experts who question the DNA evidence, calling their review \"embarrassing, inappropriate and presented in a hostile way.\" She calls for Knox and Sollecito's sentences to be increased to life.September 26, 2011Lawyers for the civil parties to the case, including Kercher's family and falsely accused bar owner Lumumba, present their final statements. Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca presents the jury with photos of the murder victim's body that \"show you the pain of Meredith.\" Knox avoids looking at the photos. Lumumba's lawyer, Carlo Pacelli, accuses Knox of having two sides one of which is \"angelic, good, compassionate\" and the other \"Lucifer-like, demonic, satanic.\"September 27, 2011Sollecito lawyer Giulia Bongiorno attacks media portrayals of Knox as a femme fatale, comparing her to the cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, who protests, \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way,\" in the movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" She says there is no physical evidence placing Knox and Sollecito at the scene of the crime, attacks the credibility of DNA evidence and says Knox's statements to police the night of the murder should be discounted because of hostile questioning by police.October 3, 2011An Italian jury overturns the 2009 murder conviction of Knox and Sollecito. Knox is, however, judged guilty of defamation against Lumumba, an early suspect in the case. She had accused Lumumba of killing Kercher. She leaves Italy straight after the ruling, and returns to her home city of Seattle.February 17, 2012Knox signs a deal with HarperCollins to write a memoir about her trial, conviction and acquittal for murder. The book, based in part on journals she kept, will give never-before heard details about her \"harrowing experience\" while in custody there, the publisher says. March 26, 2013The Italian Supreme Court  rules that Knox and Sollecito should stand trial again. Knox's lawyer said the 25-year-old was \"upset and surprised because we thought that the case was over\" but was ready to fight to prove her innocence.September 30, 2013Retrial begins without either Knox or Sollecito present in the Florentine court.November 6, 2013Sollecito takes the stand, describing the charges against him as \"absurd\" and the evidence against him as \"an illusion.\"\"There was not a basis to charge me, to put me in jail ... I don't wish anybody on Earth to go through what I went through,\" he says.November 26, 2013An Italian prosecutor says Knox should receive a 30-year sentence for the 2007 killing. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini calls for a 26-year sentence for Sollecito.December 17, 2013Knox again maintains her innocence in a written statement presented to the court by her lawyer.\"I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,\" she says in a lengthy email, written in Italian.January 30, 2014An Italian appeals court convicts Knox and Sollecito of murder charges. Knox, who is living in the United States, had her sentence increased to 28 years and six months. Sollecito, who returned to Italy during the trial, was sentenced to 25 years. February 3, 2014Sollecito says he has returned to Italy to fight his new murder conviction. Knox has said that she \"will never go willingly\" back to Italy. But Sollecito said he came back \"as soon as I understood the verdict.\"April 29, 2014An Italian court says it convicted Knox and Sollecito of murdering her onetime roommate in part because of evidence showing that more than one person killed the British student. In a more than 300-page document, the court said that the third person convicted in the murder, Rudy Guede, did not act alone, and cited the nature of the victim's wounds. May 1, 2014Knox maintains her innocence during an interview with CNN.If she had been at the scene of the crime, forensic evidence would prove her guilt, but Knox says there is nothing -- no DNA, no hair, no footprints, no handprints -- to show she was there. \"I did not kill my friend. I did not wield a knife. I had no reason to,\" Knox said.July 1, 2014Sollecito distances himself from his ex-girlfriend. \"This has been a real tragedy,\" he says. \"I'm not a criminal.\" It's a dramatic departure from the past seven years, where the tactic has been to \"stick together\" and be \"tried\" together.March 27, 2015Italy's Supreme Court overturns the murder convictions of Knox and Sollecito. The case is now closed, the court says, and the two are free to go.Thus ends an eight-year legal saga that gripped the United States, Britain and Italy.", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/italy-amanda-knox-timeline/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130508102141-meredith-kercher-file-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-28T12:17:05Z"}, {"id": "7169a797-d0f4-5022-9401-c01f7499ec9e", "title": "Accused honeymoon killer to be extradited to South Africa", "content": "Accused honeymoon killer to be extradited to South AfricaBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1246 GMT (2046 HKT) September 29, 2011 Shrien Dewani is accused of hiring hitmen to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, in South Africa last November.Story highlightsShrien Dewani is accused of hiring hitmen to kill his wife on their honeymoonShe was shot during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South AfricaDewani denies any involvement in the killingBritain's Home Secretary Theresa May  has signed an order for British businessman Shrien Dewani's extradition to South Africa, the Home Office said in a statement on Wednesday.

Dewani now has 14 days to appeal to the High Court in an effort to overturn the decision of the district judge and the Home Secretary, the Home Office said.The businessman, from Bristol, has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing.Taxi driver Zola Tongo has confessed that he hired two men to kill Anni Dewani in November last year. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town.A court in London ruled last month that Dewani could be extradited to South Africa to face trial.

The pair were found as orphans and raised in a wild animal sanctuary in North Carolina before moving to a zoo in Denmark and eventually arriving in Leipzig in May last year. Leipzig Zoo released a statement saying: \"Heidi, our cross-eyed opossum, has closed her eyes forever today. She passed away having shown typical symptoms of her old age and having severely suffered from arthrosis.\"This illness has made it painful for her to move over the last couple of weeks and Heidi was treated with vitamins and other medicine. Following a short-lived improvement of her condition, her general state of health deteriorated over the last days despite continuous efforts by the veterinarians.\"Heidi had to be put to sleep avoid her suffering pain, in accordance with animal welfare guidelines, the zoo said. Arthrosis is a degenerative joint disease.The cause of Heidi's profoundly crossed eyes remains a mystery, although the zoo's website suggests the way she was fed when she was hand-reared in the United States may have played a role -- as well as the fact she was overweight, which led to \"fatty deposits behind the eyes which are pressing the eyeballs slightly out of the eye sockets.\"Her sister, named Naira, is also cross-eyed but the zoo's third opossum, a male called Teddy, lacks their distinctive looks.Opossums, a type of marsupial found in North and South America, have a maximum life expectancy of four to five years, the zoo's website says.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 36, "end": 41, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 53, "end": 56, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 151, "end": 156, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 268, "end": 279, "mot": "Leipzig Zoo", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 581, "end": 592, "mot": "Leipzig Zoo", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 635, "end": 640, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1028, "mot": "Leipzig Zoo", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1064, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1319, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1534, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1704, "mot": "Heidi", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2312, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"television_program": 7, "company": 2, "facility": 3}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/germany-opossum-dead/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110928075550-heidi-german-opossum-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-28T19:48:36Z"}, {"id": "80f83e8a-057d-5087-8161-d62131445907", "title": "Enigma machine sells for world record price", "content": "Enigma machine sells for world record priceBy Bryony Jones, CNNUpdated 1739 GMT (0139 HKT) September 29, 2011 Enigma machines were vital to the Nazi war effort.

The Enigma machine sold Thursday was one of several used in the 2001 film.Thousands of the machines are thought to have been produced from the 1920s, through to the end of the Second World War, but it is rare for one to come up for sale.James Hyslop, Christie's Travel, Science and Natural History specialist, said the machine's eventual sale -- to an unnamed collector -- had been greeted by a round of applause.Other items sold at the auction included a 104-year-old cookie taken on polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition.The biscuit, one of a batch fortified with milk protein and made especially for the Nimrod Expedition (1907 to 1909), sold for \u00a31,250, \u00a3250 shy of the upper estimate.Ill-fated fellow polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott's 1910 pocket diary sold for \u00a327,500 -- almost three times the \u00a310,000 estimate.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 14, "mot": "Enigma machine", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 110, "end": 116, "mot": "Enigma", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 435, "end": 441, "mot": "Enigma", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 452, "end": 456, "mot": "Kate", "types": ["artist"], "type": []}, {"start": 467, "end": 481, "mot": "Enigma machine", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 544, "end": 556, "mot": "World War II", "types": ["war"], "type": []}, {"start": 862, "end": 876, "mot": "Enigma machine", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 981, "end": 995, "mot": "Enigma machine", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1159, "mot": "Bletchley", "types": ["museum"], "type": []}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1184, "mot": "England", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1421, "mot": "Kate Winslet", "types": ["actress"], "type": []}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1433, "mot": "The Enigma", "types": ["actor"], "type": []}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1441, "mot": "Enigma machine", "types": ["device"], "type": []}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1615, "mot": "Second World War", "types": ["war"], "type": []}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1940, "mot": "Ernest Shackleton", "types": ["explorer"], "type": []}, {"start": 2056, "end": 2073, "mot": "Nimrod Expedition", "types": ["operation"], "type": []}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2189, "mot": "Robert Falcon Scott", "types": ["explorer"], "type": []}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2289, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"device": 7, "artist": 1, "war": 2, "museum": 1, "team": 1, "actress": 1, "actor": 1, "explorer": 2, "operation": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/29/world/europe/uk-enigma-machine-auction/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110919013741-enigma-machine-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-29T17:39:20Z"}, {"id": "64f95719-c27c-51b9-8391-d3d3621289fd", "title": "Red Bull's Horner hopes for Vettel stay", "content": "Red Bull's Horner hopes for Vettel stayBy Updated 1547 GMT (2347 HKT) September 28, 2011 Christian Horner hopes he can enjoy Sebastian Vettel's success for many years to come.Story highlightsChristian Horner has played down speculation linked Sebastian Vettel with FerrariHorner hopes Vettel stays with the team for many years to comeVettel can win a second drivers' championship with one point at Japanese Grand PrixRed Bull team principal Christian Horner has played down talk of Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel switching to rivals Ferrari.Vettel, 24, is one point away from becoming the sport's youngest double championship winner, and the German has previously stated a desire to drive for Italian marque Ferrari in the future.But Horner, who has been at the British-based team since 2005, dismissed suggestions a switch could be imminent and expressed his desire to keep hold of Vettel for many seasons to come.\"My guess is that right now the bull on his car is more welcome than the prancing horse [Ferrari's logo],\" Horner told Formula One's official website.Vettel wins but must wait for title\"And if I had a say I would suggest that he joins Ferrari shortly before his retirement. We are proud to have him in the team and hopefully we will have many, many more successful years ahead.\"Vettel's victory in Singapore on Sunday, his ninth of the season, means the former Toro Rosso racer can become the ninth man in F1 history to win back-to-back championships with a 10th-place finish at next month's Japanese Grand Prix.The last time Vettel failed to finish a race in a point-scoring position was at the Korean Grand Prix in October 2010, where he retired due to engine problems having qualified in pole position.Latest F1 standings after Singapore GPHorner was full of praise for his driver and claimed Vettel sets the tone of races and grinds his rivals down with his consistency.\"The title win boosted Sebastian's self-confidence significantly,\" said Horner. \"He knows now what he is capable of and builds on that.\"Right now he's the driver who sets the pattern. He's got immense speed and breath-taking consistency.\"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone echoed Horner's sentiments, and claimed humility was key to Vettel's success.\"Sebastian has an absolute will to succeed but has stayed very grounded,\" said Ecclestone. \"No win, however big, will stop him being grounded. \"That is immensely important in this business. Seb is relaxed and will always remain true to himself -- that is why things come easy.\"Vettel will look to wrap up the drivers' title at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka on October 9.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 89, "end": 105, "mot": "Christian Horner", "types": ["military_officer", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 441, "end": 457, "mot": "Christian Horner", "types": ["military_officer", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 721, "end": 728, "mot": "Ferrari", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1024, "mot": "Ferrari", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1170, "mot": "Ferrari", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1335, "mot": "Singapore", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1399, "mot": "Toro Rosso", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1768, "mot": "Singapore", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1934, "mot": "Sebastian", "types": ["saint", "martyr"], "type": ["saint"]}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2177, "mot": "Bernie Ecclestone", "types": ["businessman"], "type": []}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2265, "mot": "Sebastian", "types": ["saint", "martyr"], "type": ["saint"]}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2648, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"team": 6, "military_officer": 2, "person": 2, "manufacturer": 1, "saint": 2, "martyr": 2, "businessman": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/28/sport/motorsport/horner-vettel-red-bull/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110928024749-vettel-horner-28-9-2011-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-28T15:47:52Z"}, {"id": "fed54001-fdc5-533b-8ff3-399f3f1b4cf9", "title": "Couples names Woods and Haas as Presidents wild cards", "content": "Couples names Woods and Haas as Presidents wild cardsBy Updated 1704 GMT (0104 HKT) September 28, 2011 Bill Haas secured his place in the Presidents Cup after winning the season-ending Tour Championship Story highlightsFred Couples names Bill Haas and Tiger Woods as his wild cards for Presidents CupThe pair join 10 other Americans in biennial tournament against International sideInternational captain Greg Norman selects Aaron Baddeley and Robert Allenby as his picksFedEx Cup winner Bill Haas and 14-time major champion Tiger Woods have been named by American team captain Fred Couples as his wild card picks for the Presidents Cup next month.The pair join the 10 qualifiers via the PGA Tour for the biennial tournament against the International team at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club on November 17-20.Meanwhile, International captain Greg Norman has selected Australian pair Aaron Baddeley and Robert Allenby as his choices for the tournament, which the Americans have dominated in previous years.There is no place in the American side for U.S. PGA winner Keegan Bradley, although a left arm injury to Steve Stricker could still hand Bradley a place in the side.The Americans have a superb record in the event, winning seven of the nine previous meetings with one draw and one victory for the International side, in 1998.JUST WATCHEDCatching up with golfer Bill HaasReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatching up with golfer Bill Haas 02:35\"My team know they have lost the tournament every year apart from two and they want to win it this time around.

Champions LeagueThe 18-year-old helps Arsenal to beat Olympiakos of Greece 2-1 at the Emirates StadiumLionel Messi scored twice for Barcelona as the European champions crushed BATE Borisov 5-0 to claim their first Group H win in this season's Champions League.Barca opened the scoring in the 19th minute of a wet evening in Belarus, when Alyaksandr Volodko turned a Dani Alves cross  from the right into his own net and they doubled their lead three minutes later when Pedro headed home David Villa's left-wing center.Goalkeeper Alyaksandr Gutor gifted Barca their third, dropping Pedro's cross onto Messi's head for the Argentine's first goal of the night, while Messi added his second soon after the interval -- firing home after exchanging passes with Alves.Messi has now scored 14 goals already this season and takes his total number of Barcelona goals to 193, joint second with Hungarian Ladislao Kubala in Barca's all-time list of leading scorers.Villa added a last-gasp fifth goal for Barca, after BATE had made a mess of a free-kick, as the Catalan giants equalled their biggest-ever Champions League win.Barcelona are level on four points with Milan at the top of the group, after the Italian champions saw off  Czech side Viktoria Plzen 2-0 at the San Siro.Milan opened the scoring in the 53rd minute when Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his return from injury by netting from the penalty spot after Marian Cisovsky handled in the area.And Ibrahimovic set up Milan's second 13 minutes later, holding off his marker before slipping the ball through for Antonio Cassano to deftly find the net.BATE Borisov and Viktoria Plzen are joint third on one point apiece and already look to have a mountain to climb against the two giants of the group.Chelsea are top of Group E with four points from their first two matches, despite conceding a late penalty in a 1-1 draw at Spanish side Valencia.England midfielder Frank Lampard, who was restored to the side by manager Andre Villas-Boas after being left out of their weekend win over Swansea, opened the scoring in the 56th minute when converting Florent Malouda's pull-back.But, just three minutes from time, Roberto Soldado levelled from the spot after substitute Salomon Kalou handled a cross in the area.Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table with three points after a 2-0 home victory over Belgian champions Genk.Lars Bender opened the scoring on the half hour mark, slamming home a shot from a tight angle, and veteran midfielder Michael Ballack sealed the win in injury time with a superb volley -- his first goal in more than 18 months.  Valencia are third in the table on two points, after drawing their opening two games, with Genk propping up the others with just a single point from their two matches.In Group F, Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain entered the record books as the London side beat Olympiakos 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium.Chamberlain, 18, opened the scoring with a composed eighth minute finish to become the youngest-ever Englishman to score in the competition.Brazilian left-back Andre Santos scored his first Arsenal goal from a tight angle to double their lead before David Fuster pulled a goal back with an unmarked header from inside the area.Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund.Andre Ayew gave the hosts a 1-0 half-time lead when he fired home a low shot from outside the area and they doubled their lead in the 62nd minute when Loic Remy blasted home after superbly chesting the ball down.Ayew added his second, and Marseille's third, seven minutes later, converting from the penalty spot after Remy had been bundled to the ground by  Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl.The only down side for Marseille was the late dismissal of Jordan Ayew, who was shown a second yellow card for diving.Meanwhile, Russian champions Zenit St  Petersburg battled back from going behind to claim a 3-1 Group G win over 10-man Porto.Europa League winners Porto went ahead in the 10th minute when Colombian James Rodriguez netted from Hulk's right-wing cross, but the home side drew level 10 minutes later when Roman Shirokov scored from the edge of the area after goalkeeper Helton had deflected a Viktor Faizulin cross into his path.Porto had defender Jorge Fucile sent off for two yellow cards just before the break -- and Zenit took control in the second half.Shirokov scored his and Zenit's second when converting from close range and Danny added a third 18 minutes from time when turning home Alexander Kerzhakov's cross.However, surprise leaders of the group after two matches are Cypriot side APOEL Nicosia, who drew 1-1 at last season's quarterfinalists Shakhtar Donetsk.That result leaves APOEL on four points, with Zenit and Porto on three apiece and Shakhtar trailing on a single point.

suspended by Manchester City", "content": "Tevez suspended by Manchester CityBy Updated 1624 GMT (0024 HKT) September 29, 2011 Carlos Tevez sits with the other Manchester City substitutes at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday.Story highlightsStriker Carlos Tevez has been suspended for two weeks by Manchester CityThe suspension follows his non-appearance from the bench against Bayern MunichTevez earlier issued a statement denying that he had refused to play when askedCity coach Roberto Mancini has said Tevez will never play for the club againStriker Carlos Tevez has been suspended by Manchester City after the furore surrounding his non-appearance from the substitutes' bench during the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich on Tuesday.City manager Roberto Mancini slammed the Argentine international following his team's loss at the Allianz Arena, claiming Tevez had refused to take to the pitch and would consequently not play for the club again.And, although Tevez subsequently released a statement denying the claims, City have now confirmed that the player will be suspended for the immediate future.A statement on City's official website read: \"Manchester City can confirm that striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended until further notice for a maximum period of two weeks.\"The player's suspension is pending a full review into his alleged conduct during Tuesday evening's 2-0 defeat to Bayern Munich.\"The player will not be considered for selection or take part in training whilst the review is under way.\" Earlier on Wednesday, former Manchester United forward Tevez rejected Italian coach Mancini's claims and said the incident was a \"misunderstanding.\"\"I would like to apologise to all Manchester City fans, with whom I have always had a strong relationship, for any misunderstanding that occurred in Munich,\" read the statement from Tevez.Tevez tantrum is a disgrace to soccer\"They understand that when I am on the pitch I have always given my best for the club. In Munich on Tuesday I had warmed up and was ready to play. This is not the right time to get into specific details as to why this did not happen. But I wish to state that I never refused to play.\"There was some confusion on the bench and I believe my position may have been misunderstood. Going forward I am ready to play when required and to fulfil my obligations.\"The statement is in contrast to Tevez's remarks immediately after the match, when he appeared to reaffirm his desire to leave City.\"I think it's Mancini's decision. I've been a professional throughout,\" he told British broadcaster Sky Sports through a translator. \"I put my opinion through, that I wanted to leave for family reasons and I still played my best.\"Gomez double gives Bayern 2-0 winThe fixture in Europe's premier club competition was set to be a landmark occasion for City; whose clash with four-time European champions Bayern represented their first away match in the tournament.But the match unravelled for City, who won the English FA Cup last season, when Germany striker Mario Gomez grabbed two goals in the closing stages of the first half.Tuesday's controversy is the latest development in a saga which has seen Tevez move close to an exit from the Etihad Stadium on several occasions.The former Corinthians striker handed in a transfer request in December 2010, citing a breakdown in communications with the City board as the reason behind his decision.It looked as if Tevez was set for a return to Sao Paulo-based Corinthians in July, but the four-time Brazilian champions claimed there was insufficient time to conclude the deal.City have signed a host of attacking players in 2011, including the capture of Dzeko from Wolfsburg in January and the additions of Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid and France midfielder Samir Nasri from Arsenal in the last transfer window.As a result, Tevez has struggled to break into City's starting line-up so far this season and has seen defender Vincent Kompany replace him as club captain.\"He wanted to leave last year,\" former Inter coach Mancini told a press conference on Tuesday. \"I helped him for two years every time. He refused to play. I cannot accept this behaviour from him. I decide the substitutions, not Carlos.\"Do you think at Bayern Munich one player can play like this? Or Milan or Manchester United? No. There were 30 minutes to the end. There was time to change the game.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "mot": "Tevez", "types": ["player", "forward"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 84, "end": 96, "mot": "Carlos

Peter Taggart, For CNN Updated 1251 GMT (2051 HKT) September 28, 2011 Story highlightsSen. David Norris makes a comeback to get on the ballotHe would be Ireland's first openly gay presidentHis rivals include former IRA commander-turned-politician Martin McGuinnessSeven candidates face off in the October 27 ballotFormer IRA local commander-turned-politician Martin McGuinness will have to defeat an openly gay senator and a popular Labour party politician, among others, if he is to become president of the Republic of Ireland, it emerged Wednesday as the election ballot was finalized.Sen. David Norris completed an extraordinary comeback Tuesday, securing the political backing he needed to get onto the ballot after withdrawing over a sex scandal in August, then changing his mind and jumping back into the race.He leads the field, according to an opinion poll published in the Sunday Business Post this week, followed by Michael D. Higgins of the Labour Party and McGuinness, the Sinn Fein politician who stepped down as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland to run for president of the republic.There will be a record seven candidates in the election October 27.Norris -- tipped to be the country's first openly gay head of state -- got onto the ballot, thanks to an 11th-hour intervention by his rival Higgins.Ahead of a vote by Dublin city councilors, Higgins recommended to Labour colleagues they facilitate the entry of Norris to the presidential race \"in the interests of democracy.\"Higgins criticized the nominations procedure, calling it archaic. To stand in the election, candidates need the backing of four local authorities, or 20 parliamentarians.The lifeline from Dublin marks a remarkable return to the presidential contest for Norris. At the start of August, he withdrew from the race following revelations he had written letters seeking leniency for a former partner convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old boy in Israel.In recent weeks, Norris reconsidered due to what he called \"overwhelming public support.\" The independent candidate admitted Tuesday it was an \"extraordinary comeback\" to get his name on the ballot paper. \"If I can make this extraordinary comeback, then this country can make an equally extraordinary comeback and I hope to be there at the head of it,\" Norris said.Earlier on Tuesday, former Eurovision song contest winner and ex-member of the European Parliament, Dana Rosemary Scallon, received the backing she needed from a fourth local council to run, also as an independent.The seven-candidate list is now complete and Norris appears to be a frontrunner. A weekend opinion poll showed him ahead with 21% support, Higgins second with 18% and McGuinness third with 16%.Dana Rosemary Scallon finished bottom in the opinion poll. The other candidates in the election are Gay Mitchell of the main ruling party Fine Gael and two more independents, Mary Davis and Sean Gallagher.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 66, "end": 69, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 138, "end": 150, "mot": "David Norris", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 480, "end": 486, "mot": "Labour", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 639, "end": 651, "mot": "David Norris", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 999, "end": 1011, "mot": "Labour Party", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1041, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1440, "mot": "Labour", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2107, "mot": "The independent", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2465, "mot": "European Parliament", "types": ["institution"], "type": []}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2488, "mot": "Dana Rosemary Scallon", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2795, "mot": "Dana Rosemary Scallon", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2886, "mot": "Gay Mitchell", "types": ["politician", "politician"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 2912, "end": 2921, "mot": "Fine Gael", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 2964, "end": 2968, "mot": "Sean", "types": ["actor", "producer"], "type": ["actor"]}, {"start": 2990, "end": 2998, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 2, "politician": 6, "party": 5, "newspaper": 1, "institution": 1, "actor": 1, "producer": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/ireland-president/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-28T10:51:24Z"}, {"id": "13ac290c-f4ed-5f88-b5f9-704d92b69f96", "title": "France will not extradite former Rwandan leader's widow", "content": "France will not extradite former Rwandan leader's widowBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1911 GMT (0311 HKT) September 29, 2011 Former Rwandan first lady Agathe Habyarimana, pictured in 1977, faces a warrant on genocide charges.Story highlightsRwanda's former first lady is \"relieved\" and \"very satisfied,\" her lawyer says\"This is a very delicate case,\" her lawyer says Agathe Habyarimana still faces a civil suitA French appeals court on Wednesday rejected a Rwandan request to extradite the widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide.Lawyer Philippe Meilhac said his client, former first lady Agathe Habyarimana, was \"relieved\" and \"very satisfied\" with the court's decision. \"This is a very delicate case, as it can also impact relations between France and Rwanda, so this decision is important and in many ways symbolic,\" Meilhac said.Habyarimana still faces a civil suit dating from 2007, when a French Rwandan rights collective accused her of being involved in the genocide, Meilhac said. Habyarimana has asked to be heard by a judge but is still waiting to be summoned, he said.She faces a Rwandan warrant on genocide charges that include crimes against humanity, specifically murder and extermination; creation of a criminal gang, namely the Hutu militias; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the Geneva Conventions, John Bosco Mutangana, the head of Rwanda's Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit, said last year. Habyarimana left Rwanda for France soon after the violence broke out. Meilhac said there have been roughly 10 extradition requests during her 15 years in France. Her husband, the former president, was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The mass killings began hours later, and by the time they ended 100 days later, 800,000 people had been killed.Most were members of the country's Tutsi minority, killed by members of the Hutu majority.The circumstances surrounding the former president's death remain a mystery. He was a Hutu, and speculation immediately fell on Tutsis -- but some have also speculated that Hutus themselves may have shot down the plane to provide cover for the ensuing genocide.Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide have been tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania.Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried by local communities in \"gacaca\" courts, which allow survivors to confront their attackers. Some human rights organizations have criticized the gacaca courts for falling short on delivering justice.Habyarimana has no residency permit, having been refused legal status by the French prefecture.

By Tuesday he was an Internet sensation.Was it that he said, as someone who bets against markets rising, that he \"goes to bed every night dreaming of a recession?\" Was it that he said investment bank Goldman Sachs ruled the world and not governments? Or was it that bloggers started to ask if he was just a \"fake trader\" who duped the media?Take your pick. But Rastani caused a stir by saying what many people think those in the markets think anyway -- it's OK to make money out of falling markets and there is no reason not to prepare for that. He certainly thinks the markets will crash again and people should be prepared for that, and that the average person should take steps now to protect their assets, or be prepared to lose their investments. There is nothing wrong with giving that kind of advice, if that is what you think will happen. It's just unlikely you would hear that from an established player from a bank that is looking for clients. Still, it was worth hearing more from Rastani and to find out if he really believes what he said, if he understood the stir around him and whether he is in fact a trader.CNN brought him in, and I asked him all that.Firstly, Rastani is an amateur trader using his own money (as a \"hobby\", he has told other media) and he's not registered with the Financial Services Authority to trade other people's money. He doesn't claim otherwise, but there was a feeling after his first interview that he was some sort of suit from the City or Wall Street giving sage advice to his clients.He does or can have other clients though. His website calls him a speaker and trainer of others who want to trade.In my interview, Rastani said he does trade being prepared for a recession, but that as a \"human being you don't want it. As a trader you think differently. You're going to have volatile... conditions to make money in that market.\"He also said he was a religious man. He was also clearly nervous about the whole affair and was undecided for an hour to whether he should actually sit on our set for the interview. He said no a few times, before we sat down.\"The question is, why are they paying attention to this?\" he asked. \"In my opinion somebody out there doesn't want my voice to be heard and they want to attack me and damage me.\"He talked of the 'Big Boys' being desperate to keep people like him from talking about the coming economic storm.He admits there may be a book in the works, but one that focuses on traders whom he admires.When I asked him if he was for real, he said he would not say things about the markets he did not truly believe. When I asked him if he is a member of the so-called \"Yes-Men\" who have faked TV interviews in the past, he would not say yes or no. \"Let people believe what they want to,\" he said.To my mind, he should have been touted up front as a guy who has strong opinions on the markets, but certainly not as a 'trader' or \"investment adviser\" in the classic sense. That does not make his view any more or less valid but, with that preamble, I don't think it would have gone viral.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 783, "end": 798, "mot": "investment bank", "types": ["institution"], "type": []}, {"start": 799, "end": 812, "mot": "Goldman Sachs", "types": ["firm"], "type": []}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1927, "mot": "Financial Services Authority", "types": ["agency"], "type": []}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3685, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"institution": 1, "firm": 1, "agency": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/uk-trader-viral/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110928064202-trader-rastani-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-28T16:40:55Z"}, {"id": "1992359d-3f11-527e-bd79-33082c33d83e", "title": "McIlroy aims for the top of the world", "content": "McIlroy aims for the top of the worldFrom Don Riddell, CNNUpdated 1919 GMT (0319 HKT) September 29, 2011 JUST WATCHEDMcIlroy eyes world number oneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMcIlroy eyes world number one 04:26Story highlightsRory McIlroy has set his sights on becoming the world's best golferMcIlroy has already clinched his first major in 2011 at the U.S. OpenThe 22-year-old has recently started a relationship with tennis star Caroline WozniackiBritish golfer Rory McIlroy has enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2011, winning his first major championship and climbing to third in the world rankings.But far from resting on his laurels, the 22-year-old has set his sights on usurping compatriot Luke Donald as the world's top-ranked golfer in 2012.\"Number one is a huge achievement,\" McIlroy told CNN. \"To be able to call yourself the best in your field is a huge accomplishment. So hopefully I can get closer to that goal this year and then maybe be able to achieve it next year. \"World number one is a big goal, but winning tournaments and winning majors should take care of that.\"Look out Europe -- American golf is bouncing backWinning a major is something McIlroy has already familiarized himself with, emulating fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell's 2010 achievement by capturing a record-breaking U.S. Open triumph at Congressional in June.McIlroy looked set to secure a first career major two months earlier at the Masters, when he led the field by four shots heading into the final round at Augusta.But, despite his considerable lead at the start of the fourth day, McIlroy collapsed, carding a round of 80 to finish tied for 15th position, and his final day disappointment in Georgia is one of the few regrets he has this year.\"This year has been great. If anything, obviously the last round at Augusta would have been one to take back.\"And maybe playing the shot from behind the tree root in the PGA ...to ruin my chances on the third hole of the tournament wasn't the smartest idea in the world.\"JUST WATCHEDStars show for JapanReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStars show for Japan 02:41McIlroy sustained an injury to his wrist when he struck a tree root on the opening day of the PGA Championship while attempting to strike his ball from the rough.As a result of the setback the two-time winner on the PGA Tour could only manage to finish tied for 64th position, but McIlroy admitted it would have been impossible to talk him out of attempting the risky shot.When asked if his caddy JP Fitzgerald could have dissuaded him from taking the swing, McIlroy replied: \"No, I'm too stubborn. I don't listen on the golf course.\"With me it seems I have to make the mistake first and then I'll learn from it, and hopefully I'll do the right thing the next time.\"One person McIlroy has been listening to is the world's number one female tennis player -- Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki.The relationship between McIlroy and the 21-year-old has boosted his international profile even further, and he admitted the two share advice on how to deal with the rigors of top-level competition.\"It's been great,\" said McIlroy of Wozniacki. \"I've spent a lot of time with Caroline over the past couple of months and we're getting on great together. I'm trying to improve my tennis and she's trying to improve her golf a little bit.\"I think the mental side of sport is huge and just to talk through different situations, how you were feeling and what went through your head and what you could have done differently. \"Maybe I can use some experiences of my own to help her and she can use some of hers to help me.

fantasies\" and acquit the pair.Knox and Sollecito are fighting their conviction for killing Kercher -- Knox's roommate -- in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. As she began her closing arguments Tuesday, Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered.\"The room speaks only of Rudy\" Guede, the other man convicted separately of killing Kercher, Bongiorno told the jury.Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Guede, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for the murder, could have been the sole killer.Evidence that Guede was in the room shows that \"no one could enter that room and not leave any trace,\" said Bongiorno, who represents Sollecito.She urged the jury to think about her client as they made their decision.\"The lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed. You must today evaluate if - if - if these kids committed the crime,\" Bongiorno told jurors.Bongiorno, one the highest-profile lawyers in Italy, attacked media coverage of the trial as sensational, saying it could have affected what witnesses told the court.She rejected the notion that Knox and Sollecito were into violent sex, saying they rubbed noses in \"Eskimo kisses.\"The lawyer also attacked the circumstances under which Knox was interrogated by police the night of the murder, saying she was interrogated by \"hostile\" officers, which made it impossible to trust what she said that night.\"If one is not calm, anything can happen,\" Bongiorno argued.And she hammered home attacks on DNA evidence that have been a key part of the appeal. She said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence, playing video from the police investigation itself to make her point.Knox and Sollecito are appealing the convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial.Both defendants were in court Tuesday, with Knox in a long-sleeved pink sweater and Sollecito in a long-sleeved prune-colored shirt. Their parents were in court as well.On Monday, the lawyer for Kercher's family showed photos of the British murder victim's bloodied body, pointing out multiple stab wounds. He urged the Italian jury not to overturn Knox and Sollecito's convictions. \"I show you these pictures to show you the pain of Meredith,\" Francesco Maresca said.\"She didn't have defensive wounds. It means that she was tied up, that she had more than one aggressor,\" the lawyer said.\"Given the type, number and locations of the wounds, there had to be multiple attackers,\" he insisted, rejecting the defense theory that Guede acted alone.He attacked as \"useless\" a review of DNA evidence that may cast doubt on the original convictions.JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox appeal in final stretchReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox appeal in final stretch 04:50JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox appeal nears end    ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox appeal nears end     02:39JUST WATCHEDKnox's dad responds to 'she-devil' claimReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKnox's dad responds to 'she-devil' claim 05:29Knox avoided looking at the photographs of Kercher's body as they were shown.Lawyers for the civil suits related to the case presented their closing arguments Monday. At the hearing, another lawyer called Knox two-faced and \"diabolical.\"\"Within her lives a double soul: one which is angelic, good, compassionate ... tender and ingenuous,\" Carlo Pacelli said.But she had another side, he said: \"A Lucifer-like, demonic, satanic, diabolical one which sometimes leads her to borderline and dissolute behavior,\" saying that was the Knox who had killed her roommate.Pacelli sought to portray Knox as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for his client, Patrick Lumumba. Knox accused Lumumba of the murder in 2007. He was arrested but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages.A verdict in the appeal could come as soon as October 1.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 8, "end": 12, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 38, "end": 41, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 326, "end": 330, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 670, "end": 674, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 834, "end": 838, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1156, "mot": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", "types": ["album"], "type": []}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1201, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1496, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1539, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1695, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2582, "end": 2586, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2678, "mot": "The lawyer", "types": ["magazine"], "type": []}, {"start": 2723, "end": 2727, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 3321, "end": 3325, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 3626, "end": 3630, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4138, "end": 4142, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4204, "end": 4208, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4257, "end": 4261, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4320, "end": 4324, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4685, "end": 4689, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 5008, "end": 5012, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 5067, "end": 5071, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 5170, "end": 5177, "mot": "Lumumba", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 5179, "end": 5183, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 5192, "end": 5199, "mot": "Lumumba", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 5295, "end": 5299, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 5420, "end": 5428, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"minister": 25, "theologian": 25, "company": 2, "album": 1, "magazine": 1, "politician": 2}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/27/world/europe/italy-knox-appeal/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110926101357-amanda-knox-appeal-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-27T05:59:32Z"}, {"id": "f52472d2-bb30-5efd-a02f-0f8b2c018cc7", "title": "Love wants Woods for 2012 Ryder Cup", "content": "Love wants Woods for 2012 Ryder CupBy Updated 1505 GMT (2305 HKT) September 27, 2011 Tiger Woods, right, and Davis Love III were paired together at August's PGA Championship.Story highlightsU.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III wants Tiger Woods in his 2012 teamFred Couples has picked Woods as a wildcard for the Presidents Cup in NovemberThe former world No. 1 has dropped down the rankings to 50th after two hard yearsWoods has hired Couples' former caddy Joe LaCava as his new bagmanU.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III plans to emulate the decision of his Presidents Cup counterpart Fred Couples and select former world number one Tiger Woods for next year's contest with Europe.Woods, a 14-time major winner, has struggled with form and fitness since problems in his personal life emerged two years ago. The American has slipped to 50th in golf's world rankings, having not won a tournament since the Australian Masters in November 2009.But the 35-year-old's recent slump has not prevented Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, from selecting Woods as a wildcard pick for November's Presidents Cup clash with the International team in Australia.\"Well I've been asked that a lot, what would I do if I was in Fred's situation,\" Love, himself a former major champion, told a press conference at Medina Golf and Country Club in Chicago, the venue for the 2012 Ryder Cup.Look out Europe: American golf is bouncing back\"You certainly want one of the best players ever in the game, you want him on your team. I'm hoping, for Tiger's sake, that he has a full healthy season next year and we are not in this situation. That he's back to his form and he's ready to go.\"I would love to play as Tiger Woods' partner in a Presidents Cup or a Ryder Cup. So I would probably have to go with exactly what Fred did.\" Woods has played in six Ryder Cups since 1997, but his only experience of team victory came at Brookline, Massachusetts in 1999 after missing out due to injury three years ago.He had planned to take the rest of this year off, but his Presidents Cup selection persuaded him to enter the Frys.com Open starting October 6, when he will be partnered by new caddy Joe LaCava -- who carried Couples' bag for more than 20 years.LaCava left Couples this year when the 51-year-old decided to reduce his playing schedule, and worked with 2010 Ryder Cup player Dustin Johnson until the end of the PGA Tour's recent FedEx Cup playoffs.\"Joe is an outstanding caddy,\" Woods told his official website on Sunday. \"I have known him for many years. I've personally seen the great job he did for Freddie. I'm anxious for us to be working together.\"LaCava added: \"I'm excited to be working with Tiger.

Over six weeks next spring, London's Globe Theatre will present all 37 of  the Bard's plays in 37 languages, performed by companies from as many countries.Theater groups from the newly independent nation of South Sudan and conflict-torn Afghanistan, as well as the Balkans, China, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, France, Russia and Belarus will be among those taking part. One play, Love's Labour's Lost, will be performed entirely in British Sign Language (BSL), used by the deaf community, while the Q Brothers from Chicago will stage Othello in hip hop. Tom Bird, festival director for the Globe to Globe event -- which will run from April to June as part of the \"cultural Olympiad\" ahead of the London 2012 Olympics -- told CNN it was the most ambitious project of its kind.Between a third and a half of the plays to be staged had already been adapted into the various languages, but the festival's organizers also traveled widely looking for talented theater groups to create new adaptations.They were \"completely bowled over\" by the enthusiasm shown for the project by countries around the world, he said, and had to make some difficult decisions about who would make the cut.\"The tricky thing is we can't get everyone in, so we thought a little bit about the languages that are spoken in London, like Urdu, Yoruba and Polish,\" Bird said. \"We also looked at countries that have a great long history of performing Shakespeare, like Georgia and Armenia, and finally if there was a very good show, we could take that anyway.\"Some of the groups chosen to take part face \"incredible obstacles that no European or Western theater company would have to put up,\" he said.The actors from Afghanistan had been rehearsing in the British Council compound in the capital, Kabul, that was attacked last month, leaving eight people dead and twice as many injured. \"Luckily they weren't there on that day, but it was really a very, very lucky miss,\" Bird said.The Afghan actors cannot currently get visas for Britain in Kabul, so will have to rehearse The Comedy of Errors in India and then travel to London from there, he said.Acting involving both men and women, the latter not always covering their heads, also presents a cultural challenge, he added.The theater company from South Sudan gave its first performance at independence day celebrations this summer, as the new nation emerged from decades of civil conflict.The group will perform William Shakespeare's Cymbeline in Juba Arabic, in what will be \"a great moment in the history of the country,\" Bird said.The three plays of Henry VI, about England's first great civil war of the 15th century, will be staged as a Balkan trilogy by the national theaters of Serbia, Albania and Macedonia, whose actors can draw on the region's recent turbulent past.Globe to Globe's statement points to the Belarus Free Theater -- which will perform King Lear -- as \"the world's bravest theater company\" for its work, \"which it does in spite of the threat of state persecution.\" The Palestinian group Ashtar Theater, from Ramallah, will present Richard III in Palestinian Arabic, while the Israeli National Theater company Habima will perform The Merchant of Venice in Hebrew.Bird hopes the range of languages represented will bring a new audience to the Globe, a reproduction of the original Elizabethan theater on the banks of the River Thames in which William Shakespeare himself had a stake.An estimated 60,000 Bangla speakers live in London's inner city Tower Hamlets area, he said -- and the festival organizers hope many will want to see The Tempest performed in that tongue.Some of the 130,000 Brazilians in London could also flock to the Globe to see Romeo and Juliet performed in Brazilian Portuguese by a troupe from Belo Horizonte.As for those theater enthusiasts who don't speak a myriad of languages? They won't find a line-by-line subtitling of each play, Bird said, but a synopsis will be provided so people can follow the gist of what is happening -- and performances will be limited to no more than two-and-a-quarter hours in length.

The suspects, aged 36 to 49, allegedly supported \"terrorist groups that operate in the Algerian area of the Maghreb, specifically for al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,\" a ministry statement said.     They also had suspected links to Islamic militants in Italy, France and Switzerland.     Some 150 Civil Guards took part in the operation, making nearly simultaneous arrests and conducting searches of homes and premises linked to the suspects in two towns of northern Guipuzcoa province and two others in neighboring Navarra province, the statement said.      Computer hardware and software was seized and will be analyzed. Spain's National Court, which handles cases of terrorism, is supervising the operation, the statement said.       Spanish authorities have said repeatedly in the past few years that the group known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is of key concern, because of its operational base in northern Africa, just across the Mediterranean Sea from Spain and southern Europe.    Last week, Civil Guards arrested a Cuban man on Spain's Mallorca Island in the Mediterranean for allegedly recruiting and indoctrinating others for Islamic terrorist activities.    A judge released the suspect from custody Friday, but he must report daily to police while authorities investigate computer documentation seized when he was detained.     Since the Madrid train bombings of 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others, Spanish police have arrested more than 400 suspected al Qaeda militants or collaborators, the Interior Ministry website says. Most have been of North African or Middle Eastern origin, with a few from Latin America.

Citing differences with the president, particularly related to defense spending, Kudrin said that he would not remain in a government led by Medvedev, Interfax said.The state-run RIA-Novosti news agency said Kudrin resigned.The announcement came shortly after Medvedev had given Kudrin, 50, until the end of the day to decide whether to quit. Medvedev urged that Kudrin to \"make up his mind about his political future,\" according to the non-governmental, Moscow-based Interfax news agency.Kudrin was unapologetic in a statement Tuesday.\"My statement about the fact that I do not see myself as a member of a  2012 Cabinet of ministers was well thought-out and balanced.\"Under Kudrin's tenure, Russia paid off most of its foreign debt and created oil wealth funds that helped the nation weather the global economic problems of recent years, RIA-Novosti said.Siluanov, 48, has worked at  the Finance Ministry for  26 years and is in charge of inter-budget relations and defense funding. But he has not been a public figure and few have heard his name.The finance shakeup comes as Putin, who served two terms as president from 2000 to 2008, announced Saturday he plans to return next year to the presidency and trade roles with Medvedev by naming him prime minister.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 42, "end": 45, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 103, "end": 117, "mot": "Vladimir Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 138, "end": 151, "mot": "Igor Shuvalov", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "mot": "Vladimir Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 461, "end": 475, "mot": "Anton Siluanov", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 593, "end": 614, "mot": "Deputy Prime Minister", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 615, "end": 628, "mot": "Igor Shuvalov", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 706, "end": 711, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 817, "end": 832, "mot": "Dmitry Medvedev", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["president"]}, {"start": 844, "end": 849, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1014, "mot": "Washington", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1189, "mot": "Interfax", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1220, "mot": "RIA-Novosti", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1506, "mot": "Interfax", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1542, "mot": "unapologetic", "types": ["album"], "type": []}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1880, "mot": "RIA-Novosti", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2112, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2311, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"politician": 11, "company": 6, "minister": 4, "president": 1, "institute": 1, "album": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/27/world/europe/russia-finance-minister/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110928022129-russia-putin-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-27T14:55:53Z"}, {"id": "1cc82182-8550-521e-b51a-1d3493ab38aa", "title": "Remember Kercher's suffering, Knox jury told", "content": "Remember Kercher's suffering, Knox jury toldBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 2006 GMT (0406 HKT) September 26, 2011 Amanda Knox attends her appeal hearing on Monday in the city of Perugia, Italy.Story highlightsA lawyer calls Amanda Knox two-faced, with a \"diabolical\" sideAnother lawyer shows the court photos of the victim's bloodied bodyKnox and Raffaele Sollecito are fighting their murder convictionsTheir lawyers are due to make final arguments this weekThe lawyer for Meredith Kercher's family showed photos of the British murder victim's bloodied body Monday, pointing out multiple stab wounds, as he urged an Italian jury not to overturn the murder convictions of Amanda Knox and Rafaelle Sollecito.\"I show you these pictures to show you the pain of Meredith,\" Francesco Maresca said.\"She didn't have defensive wounds.

His closing arguments were based on earlier testimony by friends of Kercher's.Curt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, said the language used by the lawyer \"was extraordinarily hard to listen to.\"\"What I find very hard to believe is how this person can start calling her that when he's never even talked to her, never met her,\" Curt Knox told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday night.Knox accused Lumumba of the murder in 2007. He was arrested but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages.Knox's accusation of Lumumba shows that she committed the crime, Pacelli argued. \"Knox told lies,\" he said, adding that she was guilty and her conviction should stand.He urged the court not to \"fall under the spell of the defendant\" but to \"stick to the proof.\"Knox testified in the initial trial that comments she made to police the night of the killing were the result of stress, mistreatment by police and inadequate translation help.Lawyers are making closing arguments this week, and a verdict could come as soon as October 3.Curt Knox said the defense will begin presenting its final arguments Tuesday, \"and I think we're going to see a very different picture of what this case is all about, and so will the world.\"\"What we saw and what we heard in the first three hearings is really all circumstantial evidence,\" Curt Knox said. \"When it really comes down to the nuts and bolts of this case, you're going to hear in the next couple of days there really is no forensic case.\"Knox was in court Monday, wearing an off-white top and black hooded sweater as the months-long process nears its conclusion.Curt Knox said his daughter has had trouble sleeping and has lost weight in recent weeks.\"These two judges and six jurors really have her life in their hands, and these last three hearings have been extraordinarily hard,\" he said.Sollecito was also present at Monday's hearing, with his hair cut short. He wore a long-sleeved shirt with a geometric pattern.The defense has sought to discredit DNA evidence linking the two of them to the killing, in which Kercher's throat was slashed. Her semi-clothed body was found in the house they shared in Perugia, a picturesque central Italian university town.An Italian prosecutor put forward a vigorous defense in closing arguments Saturday of the DNA evidence used to find her guilty. Prosecutor Manuela Comodi rejected testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence, insisting police forensic officers had handled the DNA material properly. And she urged the court to increase Knox and Sollecito's sentences to life. Comodi's appearance came on the second day of closing arguments for prosecutors in the appeal.On Saturday, she told jurors that the original court had concluded \"beyond any reasonable doubt\" that blood from both Knox and Kercher found in the bathroom sink had been left there when Knox washed herself after the killing. The prosecutor also pointed to a partial footprint with Kercher's blood found on a bathroom mat, saying analysis had shown that it was most likely to have been left by Sollecito.He and Knox say they were at Sollecito's house on the night Kercher died, not the villa the two girls shared.But Maresca disputed that Monday, calling their claim the \"false alibi.\" Under Italian law, he said, in a trial based on circumstantial evidence, a defendant's alibi that turns out to be false can be used against them. The computer from Sollecito's house showed no activity on the night in question, he said, suggesting that he and Knox were not there.Defense attorneys for Sollecito are expected to present their final arguments Tuesday, to be followed by Knox's attorneys Thursday.Knox will be allowed to address the court one more time before the jury begins its deliberations, an opportunity her father says she has been thinking about the past three months.\"This is really her final opportunity to express her heartfelt thoughts as it relates to how she's being judged and the fact that she had nothing to do with this horrific crime and that Meredith was her friend,\" Curt Knox said.Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial.Powered by Livefyre", "ents":

strike sees Bayern sink Man City", "content": "Gomez double strike sees Bayern sink Man CityBy Updated 0858 GMT (1658 HKT) September 28, 2011 Mario Gomez celebrates the second of his two goals in their victory over Manchester CityStory highlightsBayern Munich defeat Manchester City 2-0 in Champions League Group AMario Gomez scores twice for Bayern who have a maximum six points from two gamesFormer City captain Carlos Tevez refuses to come onto the pitch as a second half substituteManchester United score a last-gasp equalizer to earn a 3-3 home draw with BaselChampions League newcomers Manchester City are still waiting for their first win in the competition as a double from Mario Gomez gave in-form Bayern Munich a 2-0 Group A victory at the Allianz Arena.Bayern went into the match on the back of nine successive victories and they always looked dangerous in the first half, with Bastian Schweinsteiger volleying over the crossbar from close range in the 36th minute. However, the home side took the lead just two minutes later when goalkeeper Joe Hart did superbly to keep out shots from Frank Ribery and Thomas Mueller, but Gomez was on hand to stab home from three meters out.And the same player added a second goal on the stroke of half-time when Daniel Van  Buyten's header was wonderfully saved by Hart, only for Gomez to be on hand again from close range.City could find no response after the break, and a bad night for them was made worse when manager Roberto Mancini later confirmed that former captain Carlos Tevez refused to come onto the pitch in the second half after being named only as a substitute.An angry Mancini told reporters:  \"I asked him to go on and help the team. We have 11 players -- maybe he was disappointed because he didn't play from the start. If I have my way he will be out of the club.\"The result leaves Bayern top of the table with a maximum six points from their two games, with Napoli second on four points after the Italian side beat Villarreal 2-0 in Naples.They opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Marek Hamsik chested down Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross at the back post, before firing home with his left foot.And Edinson Cavani added a second from the penalty spot just three minutes later after Lavezzi was fouled by Gonzalo Rodriguez in the area.Big-spending City, who are joint top of the English Premier League with five wins and a draw from their six games so far, are back in third  with just a single point following their opening home draw against Napoli, while Spanish side Villarreal are bottom of the group without a point, or a goal, so far.Meanwhile, 2010 champions Inter Milan made it two wins out of two under new coach Claudio Ranieri with a thrilling 3-2 Group B victory at CSKA Moscow.Ranieri replaced Gian Piero Gasperini last week, and began his San Siro tenure with a 3-1 Serie A win at Bologna over the weekend.And Inter showed they had got their shock opening 1-0 defeat by Trabzonspor out of their system, by repelling a CSKA fightback to secure their first victory in the tournament.Brazilian defender Lucio fired Inter ahead from the edge of the box after just six minutes and the Italian side doubled their lead midway through the half, when Giampaolo Pazzini netted from close range after fine work from Yuto Nagatomo.  However, the Russian side pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed Alan Dzagoev free-kick and Brazilian Vagner Love levelled with 13 minutes remaining with a low drive.But, just a minute later, Mauro Zarate converted from Esteban Cambiasso's pass to give Inter a vital victory.The other group match saw Trabzonspor and Lille share a 1-1 draw in Turkey.Moussa Sow opened the scoring for the French side when he converted Eden Hazard's pass from a tight angle, but the home side earned a draw in the 75th minute when Gustavo Colman scored from the penalty spot after Mathieu Debuchy handled in the area.The result sees Trabzonspor top the group with four points, ahead of Inter on three, Lille on two and CSKA Moscow on a single point.Premier League leaders Manchester United needed a last-gasp Ashley Young goal to rescue a 3-3 Group C draw at home to Swiss side Basel, in a thrilling match that saw United squander a comfortable two-goal lead.United took a 16th minute lead when Danny Welbeck, in for the injured Wayne Rooney, was left unmarked in the area to score off the post, and the young England international added his second just a minute later when side-footing home a Ryan Giggs pass.But United took their foot off the gas and Basel pulled a goal back when Fabian Frei lashed home in the 58th minute after the United defense were slow to clear a corner.And, just two minutes later, Basel drew level when Frei's right-wing cross was superbly headed home by his namesake Alex Frei.Basel looked to have stolen a famous victory when they went ahead in the 75th minute after Antonio Valencia fouled Marco Streller in the area and Alex Frei scored the resulting penalty.   But Young's late header from Nani's cross rescued a point for United, although they surrendered their 20-match winning run at Old Trafford in all competitions.Benfica beat  Otelul Galati 1-0 in Romania in the other group game,  which leaves Basel and Benfica level on top of the group on four points, with Manchester United third on two points after drawing their opening two matches.Real Madrid are top of  Group D with a maximum six points from their two matches, after a 3-0 win over Ajax at the Bernabeu.Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he converted a fine flowing move that saw five players involved.And the Spanish giants doubled their lead four minutes before the break when Kaka fired home a left-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net from Ronaldo's pass.The home side secured the points early in the second half when Kaka found Karim Benzema, who found the net from 10 yards out.Lyon are second in the table with four points after they beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-0  at the Stade de Gerland in their 100th Champions League game.Bafetimbi Gomis opened the scoring with a sublime chip and Bakary Kone sealed the points from close range.   Ajax are third in the group with a single point, while Zagreb are bottom after losing their opening two matches.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 25, "end": 31, "mot": "Bayern", "types":

Story highlightsThe French Senate is chosen by elected officialsThe Socialists have never held a majority in the Senate during the Fifth RepublicThe development could be a bad sign for President SarkozyThe Socialist Party was celebrating its victory Monday and looking forward to a stronger position going into the upcoming presidential elections after taking control of the French Senate for the first time since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958. The results from the indirect elections held Sunday showed that the left now controls 177 Senate seats, two more than the 175 needed for an absolute majority. \"The 25 of September 2011, will go down in history,\" Jean Pierre Bel, the Socialist's leader in the Senate told French media Sunday evening. The historic victory comes just seven months before France's presidential election in April and is viewed by many as a blow to President Nicolas Sarkozy and his conservative party.\"Nicolas Sarkozy will be the president who lost the right's majority in the Senate,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the new favorite to be the Socialist presidential candidate in 2012 after Dominique Strauss Kahn's campaign faltered when he was arrested in New York in May on charges of attempting to rape a hotel maid. Prosecutors later dropped the charges.Jean-Francois Cope, head of Sarkozy's UMP party, admitted the results marked a \"defeat which was disappointing but not a surprise due to the successive local defeats since 2004.\" France's Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon issued a statement saying the left had made a \"strong breakthrough.\" \"The moment of truth will come next spring. The battle begins tonight,\" he said. Politicians and analysts speculated on Monday what this defeat would mean for Sarkozy and his chances of winning the next presidential election.  \"Today, the power no longer has free rein, Nicolas Sarkozy can no longer do what he wants,\"  Pierre Moscovici , a Socialist party member said Monday morning. Political analyst St\u00e9phane Roz\u00e8s told French radio Europe 1 last Thursday it would be a bad sign for the presidency. \"Obviously if the left takes control of the Senate, it will reinforce a general feeling that the reign of Nicolas Sarkozy is coming to an end,\" said Roz\u00e8s. The Senate is chosen by 72,000 elected officials such as mayors and regional councilors.

It now hopes to bring the SS Gairsoppa's valuable cargo of silver bullion to the surface.Odyssey's senior project manager Andrew Craig said: \"We've accomplished the first phase of this project - the location and identification of the target shipwreck. Now we're hard at work planning for the recovery phase.\"Craig said he was \"extremely confident\" the company would be able to salvage the seven million ounces of silver (200 tonnes), which was worth more than \u00a3600,000 in 1941.The 412ft steel-hulled SS Gairsoppa was built in 1919 for the British India Steam Navigation Company, and originally served as a cargo ship on routes to and from the Far East, East Africa and Australia. When the Second World War broke out, she was ordered into Britain's merchant navy.JUST WATCHEDSilver-laden shipwreckReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSilver-laden shipwreck 03:29In February 1941, the SS Gairsoppa was traveling from Calcutta, India, to Liverpool, Britain, with a cargo of silver, tea and pig iron when she became separated from the rest of her convoy in bad weather. As the crew battled to bring the ship, which was running low on fuel, safely in to port at Galway in Ireland, she was struck by a torpedo from a German U-Boat.More than 30 of the 85 sailors on board the SS Gairsoppa are believed to have made it onto lifeboats, but only one, Second Officer Richard Ayres made it safely home, landing in Cornwall after drifting at sea for two weeks.Odyssey says it does not expect to find any human remains on the wreck.Neil Cunningham Dobson, Odyssey's Principal Marine Archaeologist, said that -- as a former merchant mariner -- the story of the SS Gairsoppa had struck a chord with him.\"Even though records indicate that the lifeboats were launched before the ship sank, sadly most of her crew did not survive the long journey to shore,\" he said. \"By finding this shipwreck, and telling the story of its loss, we pay tribute to the brave merchant sailors who lost their lives.\"The company won a British government contract to search for and salvage the ship. Under the terms of the agreement, it will keep 80% of the value of any silver recovered from the wreck.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 923, "end": 930, "mot": "torpedo", "types": ["instrument", "device"], "type": ["instrument"]}, {"start": 945, "end": 951, "mot": "U-Boat", "types": ["vehicle", "ship"], "type": ["ship"]}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1632, "mot": "Odyssey Marine Exploration", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1770, "mot": "U-Boat", "types": ["vehicle", "ship"], "type": ["ship"]}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2201, "mot": "U-Boat", "types": ["vehicle", "ship"], "type": ["ship"]}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2221, "mot": "World War II", "types": ["war"], "type": []}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2598, "mot": "Andrew Craig", "types": ["artist"], "type": []}, {"start": 3153, "end": 3169, "mot": "Second World War", "types": ["war"], "type": []}, {"start": 3654, "end": 3661, "mot": "torpedo", "types": ["instrument", "device"], "type": ["instrument"]}, {"start": 3814, "end": 3827, "mot": "Richard Ayres", "types": ["composer"], "type": []}, {"start": 4067, "end": 4083, "mot": "merchant mariner", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 4632, "end": 4640, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"instrument": 2, "device": 2, "vehicle": 3, "ship": 3, "company": 2, "war": 2, "artist": 1, "composer": 1, "force": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/26/world/europe/gairsoppa-shipwreck-silver/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-26T18:42:36Z"}, {"id": "b1f56625-9fcd-59c9-88d1-e60cc4f995f6", "title": "Sharapova cruises into Pan Pacific third round", "content": "Sharapova cruises into Pan Pacific third roundBy Updated 2110 GMT (0510 HKT) September 26, 2011 World number two Maria Sharapova eases into the second round of the Pan Pacific Open Story highlightsMaria Sharapova cruised into the third round of the Pan Pacific Open, JapanShe beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn in straight setsLast year Sharapova was knocked out in the first roundShe has since risen to number two in the worldMaria Sharapova beat Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand in straight sets 6-2, 7-5 to cruise into the third round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.The 24-year-old fired seven aces, including one on match point, to brush aside Tanasugarn and help banish the memories of her early exit from last year's tournament.That defeat, at the hands of the 41-year-old Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in the first round, proved to be something of a nadir for the Russian.But since then Sharapova has risen to number two on the world rankings from a career low 126 following shoulder surgery in 2009 and regained some of her early-career form.And she began strongly in Tokyo, quickly winning the first set before going 3-0 up in the second.Tanasugarn then came to life, leveling the second set 5-5 before Sharapova finished out the match in style.\"I served really well today.

He has been squeezed by the nation's prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate is almost 21%, and almost 5 million are jobless.Numerous opinion polls indicate opposition Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy, 56, has a double-digit lead -- from 10 to 15 percentage points -- over the Socialists. On Monday, Zapatero convened a Cabinet meeting, and the only order of business was to approve a decree to convene early elections on November 20. Zapatero has talked publicly about this for weeks, a sharp change from his stance earlier this year when he said he intended to serve out his full four-year term due to end in March 2012.Rajoy has lost twice to Zapatero, in 2004 and 2008. But his conservative party swept to victory in regional and local elections last May, presaging what the polls predict will be a triumph for Rajoy the third time around.He's a former Cabinet minister under the conservative administration of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar from 1996 to 2004. Rajoy has been criticized for not revealing detailed plans of how to get Spain out of its crisis, especially at a time when financial markets have battered Spain. Many international analysts say Spain could be at even further risk, along with Italy and Portugal, if troubled Greece defaults on its debt.Rajoy said over the weekend that if elected, he would install a 100-day shock plan of \"austerity and efficiency\" so that national, regional and local governments get in step to avoid duplication in spending.The Socialist candidate is Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, 60, who served under Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and most recently under Zapatero, rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and interior minister.He told supporters over the weekend that the elections during this crisis are among the most important in Spain's 30 years of democracy following the death of the long-ruling dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.After the Cabinet meeting on Monday, Zapatero formally informed King Juan Carlos of the decision and then spoke to reporters at the prime minister's compound. \"Today is not a day to take stock of this government,\" Zapatero said in a nationally-televised statement. \"Today is a day to open the balance for the candidates to present their plans and for the people to decide freely about them.\"\"I have great confidence in Spain,\" Zapatero added. \"I know that sooner than later we'll get out of these difficulties.\"The pre-campaign has been underway for months, but the official campaign will begin on November 4, two weeks before the vote.

Haas clinches the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup titles after playoff American claims $11.44 million in prize money at end-of-season event  in AtlantaHe defeats U.S. Ryder Cup star Hunter Mahan to seal his big-money triumphWorld No. 1 Luke Donald ties for third, ending his hopes of historic doubleAmerican golfer Bill Haas said he was \"very lucky\" after securing the biggest win of his career on Sunday.The 29-year-old beat U.S Ryder Cup star Hunter Mahan on the third playoff hole at the Tour Championship in Atlanta to clinch the PGA's season-ending FedEx Cup and $11.44 million in prize money.Haas needed a dramatic save after hitting a water hazard before going on to sink a four-foot putt on the par-three 18th hole at East Lake to finally see off his compatriot, after the duo had finished tied on eight under par through 72 holes.The dramatic triumph saw Haas -- whose father Jay played in the Ryder Cup on three occasions and won nine times on the PGA Tour -- leap from 25th in the FedEx Cup standings to claim the $10 million jackpot.He also pocketed $1.44 million for winning the Tour Championship, the final event in the four-tournament series, but said he was unaware of his double success until he stepped up to collect both trophies.JUST WATCHEDBill Haas wins FedEx Cup titleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBill Haas wins FedEx Cup title 01:46\"I knew I was on the line, meaning the only way I could win in my position at the start of the week was to win the tournament,\" Haas told CNN. \"Even with that happening I still could not win the FedEx Cup because other people who were way ahead of me, their points would have passed me. \"So in my head, focus on one task -- and that was to win this playoff -- and whatever happens after that, happens. The chips fell my way and I'm very lucky. \"It looked like Haas had blown his shot at glory when he hit a bogey and double bogey on the final two holes of Saturday's third round to lose a share of the lead, but a 68 on Sunday allowed him to haul himself back up the leaderboard.It then looked as if nerves might get the better of Haas when the playoff began, as he hit a loose shot into the crowd on the first additional hole before finding the water on the second.But the new world number 20 found the green with a stunning shot to force a third playoff hole, where his par putt proved enough for victory.\"When I got up there I'd heard the groans from the crowd,\" Haas said of the build-up to his incredible saving shot. \"I thought it was in the water, so I get up there and it is somewhat in the water.\"But it's not fully submerged, so in my head I said to myself, 'I do have some sort of shot here.' I hit the shot I thought I had to hit, and it came out perfect.\"Haas has also put himself in contention for the upcoming Presidents Cup clash between the U.S. and an International team starting on November 14, with American captain Fred Couples due to announce his final wildcard pick on Tuesday.\"I'm not going to say it gets me to Australia,\" Haas told the PGA Tour's official website regarding the possibility of playing in the competition, which takes place in Melbourne. \"It definitely puts me in the talk up there with some of the guys that everybody has been talking about.\"Haas hopes to use this win as a springboard for the rest of his career as he looks to match some of the illustrious names who have previously clinched the FedEx Cup.\"It's pretty sweet. You look at the names who have previously won this, I'm trying to work my way to their stature and their level of play. This is just another stepping stone, I think I can get up there,\" he said.\"It'll take a lot of work. Guys like Vijay (Singh), Jim Furyk and Tiger Woods, obviously they've put their time in, they've put their work in and I need to do the same. I've got to work hard to try and get better each and every year.\"Mahan thought he had the tournament sewn up after Haas ended up in the water, but the 29-year-old admitted Haas was in the ascendancy once his magnificent recovery shot fell close to the hole. \"I thought I had one on the second playoff hole and then he hits it out of the water to two feet,\" Mahan said. \"It seemed like he was destined to win this week.\"World number one Luke Donald knew a win at this event would be enough for him to claim the FedEx Cup, and in the process become the first man to top both the PGA and European Tour money lists.The Briton birdied three of the last five holes to finish one shot behind Haas and Mahan, in a three-way tie for third position along with South Korea's K.J Choi and Australian Aaron Baddeley.\"I guess this is what the FedExCup is all about,\" said Donald, who would have claimed victory in the series if he had finished alone in third. \"It's meant to be exciting.\"Australian Jason Day fell away in the final two holes of the final round after he hit two bogeys to slide from eight under to finish in a tie for sixth place alongside compatriot Adam Scott and American Charles Howell III.\"Obviously I'm a little disappointed that I bogeyed the last two holes,\" Day, 23, said. \"But I was trying to win out there.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start":

In Sunday's final spectacle, a roaring crowd of fans watched as the matador Jose Tomas, in his traditional \"suit of lights,\" rang down the curtain and bade farewell. The sold-out bullfight became a different type of show as animal-rights advocates protested outside the La Monumental, often clashing with pro-bullfighting supporters and calling the sport cruel.Inside La Monumental, crowds swarmed the ring, pocketing handfuls of sand as souvenirs, Spain's state-run TVE reported, while outside the arena police tried to separate pro- and anti-bullfighting activists.JUST WATCHEDBullfighting ends in CataloniaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBullfighting ends in Catalonia 01:28 \"We Catalans do not want bullfighting anymore,\" said a protester. \"Finally, it's over,\" she said.Bullfighting opponents also protested the fact that many bullfights are sponsored by public funds, an aberration to some during Spain's financial crisis. Bullfighting is an ancient sport that, according to Catalonian historians, dates to biblical times. And while it is now history in Catalonia, it is still legal in many other parts of Spain.To some Spaniards, bullfighting is synonymous with Spanish culture, an art form immortalized in the paintings of Francisco de Goya and Edouard Manet and several authors. American writer Ernest Hemingway was a passionate follower of the sport while living in Spain. \"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except for bullfighters,\" Hemingway wrote in \"The Sun Also Rises.\" Supporters of the corridas -- as bullfights are known in Spain -- maintain hopes of overturning the ban on constitutional grounds. \"I think it is terrible to ban bullfighting here because it is part of our culture,\" said a pro-bullfighting activist outside La Monumental. Animal-rights advocates disagree, claiming it is a sadistic sport resulting in the torture and abuse of the bull for the purpose of public voyeurism.  Spain's state-run TVE has stopped airing the sport, claiming it is too violent for children. Catalonia, in northeast Spain, is the second autonomous region in the country to ban the sport. The Canary Islands in 1991 became the first in Spain to ban bullfighting. Bullfighting also is common in neighboring Portugal.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 64, "end": 67, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 509, "end": 522, "mot": "La Monumental", "types": ["stadium"], "type": []}, {"start": 976, "end": 980, "mot": "rang", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["association"]}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1134, "mot": "La Monumental", "types": ["stadium"], "type": []}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1232, "mot": "La Monumental", "types": ["stadium"], "type": []}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1268, "mot": "pocketing", "types": ["art"], "type": []}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "mot": "TVE", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2098, "mot": "Francisco de Goya", "types": ["painter"], "type": []}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2116, "mot": "Edouard Manet", "types": ["artist", "painter"], "type": ["painter"]}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2170, "mot": "Ernest Hemingway", "types": ["politician", "writer", "journalist", "poet", "novelist"], "type": ["poet"]}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2313, "mot": "Hemingway", "types": ["politician", "writer", "journalist", "poet", "novelist"], "type": ["poet"]}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2342, "mot": "The Sun Also Rises", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2615, "mot": "La Monumental", "types": ["stadium"], "type": []}, {"start": 2786, "end": 2789, "mot": "TVE", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3102, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 4, "stadium": 4, "association": 1, "club": 1, "art": 1, "painter": 2, "artist": 1, "politician": 2, "writer": 2, "journalist": 2, "poet": 2, "novelist": 2, "television_program": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/europe/spain-bullfighting-ban/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110926123724-last-bullfight-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-26T00:16:44Z"}, {"id": "7e22a9a2-8d1e-5784-9998-c1a1efd26cdc", "title": "Alleged UK cell charged with terror training in Pakistan", "content": "Alleged UK cell charged with terror training in PakistanBy Paul Cruickshank, CNN Terrorism Analyst Updated 1451 GMT (2251 HKT) September 27, 2011 JUST WATCHEDUK terror suspects appear in courtReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK terror suspects appear in court 01:07Story highlightsSix British men charged with preparing for act of terrorismPolice believe two of the six went to Pakistan for lessonsThe two made martyrdom tapes, police saySix men appeared in a London court Monday charged in connection with an alleged planned terrorist bombing campaign in the United Kingdom.

Instead of conventionally striking the ball he twisted around and backheeled the ball into the corner of the net.He was immediately substituted by then coach Srecko Katanec, who was angry at what he saw was a lack of respect for the opposition.Yet the fans didn't agree. Instead the YouTube clip of his penalty went viral. More than 1.2 million people have since viewed it.\"On behalf of AFC and the Asian football family, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the UAE football community, family and friends of Awana,\" the Asian Football Confederation's acting president Zhang Jilong said in a statement.Awana's death comes soon after another young Emirati player Saeed al Nooby, who played for second division side Al Dhafra, also died in a car accident. \"We had just returned last night with the club officials and players after visiting the family of Saeed al Nooby and paying our condolences,\" Bani Yas' Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira told the Dubai-based newspaper the Gulf News.\"An hour later I got a call from the club's manager informing me of the accident and I rushed to the hospital but Awana had died.\"It will take some time for the club and his teammates to get over Awana's death.

He discussed God's endless sense of mercy and forgiveness, that it's better to be agnostic and have a \"pure heart\" over being nominally Catholic and seeing the Church \"merely as an institution,\" and other lessons from the Bible, according to a transcript of his remarks from the Vatican press office.He also spoke specifically about the Church within Germany, which has been rattled by the still-simmering clergy sex abuse scandal and a perception among some Germans that it is too conservative to change with the times.\"The Church in Germany will overcome the great challenges of the present and future, and it will remain a leaven in society, if the priests, consecrated men and women, and the lay faithful -- in fidelity with their respective vocations -- work together in unity,\" Benedict said. \"The Church in Germany will continue to be a blessing for the entire Catholic world.\"The pontiff later had lunch with German bishops, before eventually heading by motorcade to the Black Forest Airport Lahr near Freiburg and the French border. There, he met with German President Christian Wulff and his wife Bettina and then said a final prayer before boarding a plane back to the Vatican.The visit was Benedict's first state visit to Germany since becoming pope in 2005, though he had made multiple less official trips home in that time.It included a talk with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as a meeting Friday at a seminary in Erfurt with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy and church personnel in Germany. He also met there with people \"who care for those injured by these crimes,\" according to a statement from the Vatican press office.\"Moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims, the Holy Father expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families,\" the statement added. \"He assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children.\"The pope has had similar meetings elsewhere, in the face of outcries from many nations in Europe, North America and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases.Benedict himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case, when he -- as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the transfer of a man within Germany in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children. But the archdiocese has said the then-cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man's case. In March 2010, the priest -- then identified only as H -- was suspended, the archdiocese of Munich and Freising announced.On Saturday, Benedict visited a predominantly Protestant region in former Communist eastern Germany and also made a stop in the traditionally Catholic southwest, which has enjoyed democratic freedoms since shortly after World War II.Catholic and Lutheran denominations alike have lost membership, but for decades German attrition hit the Protestant Church harder. Still, the enthusiasm that greeted Benedict's appointment as pope has dissipated significantly since then. According to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the scandal broke. And candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 67, "end": 70, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 128, "end": 145, "mot": "Pope Benedict XVI", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "mot": "pope", "types": ["theologian"], "type": []}, {"start": 523, "end": 531, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 708, "end": 714, "mot": "Europe", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 759, "end": 773, "mot": "Roman Catholic", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1632, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1824, "mot": "Black", "types": ["person"], "type": []}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1933, "mot": "Christian Wulff", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1954, "mot": "Bettina", "types": ["writer", "singer", "poet"], "type": ["poet"]}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2050, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2101, "mot": "pope", "types": ["theologian"], "type": []}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2232, "mot": "Angela Merkel", "types": ["politician", "president", "chemist"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2358, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2511, "mot": "Vatican press office", "types": ["unit", "company", "institution"], "type": ["institution"]}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2787, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2925, "mot": "pope", "types": ["theologian"], "type": []}, {"start": 3007, "end": 3013, "mot": "Europe", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 3056, "end": 3062, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3209, "mot": "Joseph Ratzinger", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 3563, "end": 3571, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 3596, "end": 3606, "mot": "Protestant", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3796, "end": 3804, "mot": "Lutheran", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3888, "end": 3898, "mot": "Protestant", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3949, "end": 3957, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 3975, "end": 3979, "mot": "pope", "types": ["theologian"], "type": []}, {"start": 4034, "end": 4045, "mot": "Der Spiegel", "types": ["magazine"], "type": []}, {"start": 4098, "end": 4104, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 4249, "end": 4257, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 3, "politician": 9, "philosopher": 7, "priest": 7, "theologian": 11, "union": 2, "unit": 9, "person": 1, "president": 2, "writer": 1, "singer": 1, "poet": 1, "chemist": 1, "institution": 1, "magazine": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/europe/germany-pope/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110925083605-pope-freiburg-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-25T07:53:47Z"}, {"id": "70500f6d-3f99-5395-952d-4de713072f21", "title": "Vettel wins but must wait to clinch F1 title ", "content": "Vettel wins but must wait to clinch F1 title By Updated 1956 GMT (0356 HKT) September 25, 2011 Sebastian Vettel was topping the F1 podium for the ninth time this seasonStory highlightsSebastian Vettel wins Singapore Grand Prix to extend F1 championship lead Jenson Button finishes second with Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in third Vettel needs a single point in the next race in Japan to clinch a second straight F1 crownNinth win of the season for all-conquering Vettel in his Red Bull and 19th careerRed Bull's Sebastian Vettel claimed his ninth victory of an all-conquering season in Singapore Sunday but must wait to clinch the Formula One world title for the second straight year. The German took the checkered flag in the night race ahead of Jenson Button of Britain with Mark Webber, Vettel's  teammate, in third place.The 24-year-old Vettel has a massive 124-point lead over McLaren's Button, whose fourth straight podium denied him the chance to wrap up the championship crown.He will surely achieve the feat at the Japanese Grand Prix on October 9, where he needs just a single point, after another commanding display on Singapore's Marina Bay street circuit. It was his 19th career victory.Ferrari's Fernando Alonso came home fourth and is third in the standings, one point adrift of Button, while Lewis Hamilton took fifth after a drive through penalty in his McLaren and no less than five pits stops.Another Briton, Paul Di Resta, was an excellent sixth for Force India, his best result to date in his rookie season in Formula One, ahead of Germans Nico  Rosberg in seventh for Mercedes and Adrian Sutil in the second Force India.Felipe Massa of Ferrari, who collided with Hamilton in the early stages, finished ninth with Mexican Sergio Perez in the final points scoring position in 10th. Perez had a coming together with seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, which eliminated the German in his Mercedes.But once again it was Vettel who hogged all the headlines and he is set to become the youngest-ever double champion.\"I was in control at the end and it is a great feeling to win this race --  I love the track here and it's such a challenge,\" he told the post-race press conference.\"As to the championship?

taken in UK The winners of this year's British Wildlife Photography Awards have been announced.The competition, which was established in 2009, has produced another batch of stunning entries capturing the diversity and beauty of wildlife in the UK.     An image of a jellyfish taken by Richard Shucksmith in the waters off Sula Sgeir -- an uninhabited island 41 miles north of the isle of Lewis, Scotland -- was declared the overall winner. Greg Armfield, photography and film manager at WWF -- one of the competition's several sponsors -- called it \"a truly beautiful shot,\" which \"perfectly captures its iridescent and magical qualities.\"  Shucksmith picked up \u00a35,000 ($7,800) for the shot with category winners being awarded \u00a31,000 ($1,555). The Young British Wildlife Photographers prizes went to 16-year-old Oliver Wilks for his \"Fox Yawning\" image, while Walter Lovell (aged eight) captured an amazing image of a frog and its spawn. Seventy of this year's best images will go on show at WildlifeXpo in London this October before heading off on a countrywide tour. Next year's competition opens at the beginning of February 2012. Submissions are welcome from all nationalities, but photos must be shot in the UK.

Prosecutor Manuela Comodi refuted testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence, insisting police forensic officers had handled the DNA material properly. Comodi's appearance came on the second day of closing arguments for prosecutors in the appeal in the Italian city of Perugia.Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to overturn their 2009 conviction for killing British student Meredith Kercher two years earlier. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25.Knox, who wore her hair in a ponytail and a light blue short-sleeved shirt, appeared composed and attentive in court Saturday. Her parents were present for a second day, as the months-long process nears its conclusion.The DNA evidence used to convict the pair has been scrutinized closely during the appeal, with particular attention paid to the knife used to kill Kercher and traces of DNA on her bra clasp.JUST WATCHEDAmanda Knox's mother speaks outReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanda Knox's mother speaks out 02:25JUST WATCHEDKnox murder appeal enters final stageReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKnox murder appeal enters final stage 01:31Urging the jurors to uphold the convictions for Knox and Sollecito, Comodi defended the police investigation and sought to discredit the independent experts brought in to look at the evidence.Their review had been \"embarrassing, inappropriate, and presented in a hostile way\" and was not based on science, she said.The experts had been selective in what evidence they chose to review, Comodi charged, going on to list the other DNA evidence recovered from the villa where Kercher was found half-undressed and with her throat slit in November 2007.She told jurors that the original court had concluded \"beyond any reasonable doubt\" that blood from both Knox and Kercher found in the bathroom sink had been left there when Knox washed herself after the killing. The prosecutor also pointed to a partial footprint with Kercher's blood found on a bathroom mat, saying analysis had shown it was most likely to have been left by Sollecito, of the suspects.He and Knox say they were at Sollecito's house on the night Kercher died, not the villa the two girls shared.Comodi stressed that one of the independent experts, Carla Vecchiotti, was a professor rather than a professional in the field and said the police had better experience of a crime scene.Vecchiotti and a second expert, Stefano Conti, argued in the summer that DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Kercher and on her bra clasp was not reliable and had been contaminated by poor handling.Prosecutors in 2009 said there were traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade.Comodi also questioned the testimony of another expert called by the defense, Carlo Torre, one of Italy's best-known forensics experts, who earlier this month cast doubt on the DNA evidence gathered from the knife. Comodi then rejected the evidence given by expert Sara Gino, who said traces of Sollecito's DNA found on the bra clasp could have got there when Knox's and Kercher's clothes were together in the washing machine.Comodi's statements followed the arguments Friday of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola and Giuliano Mignini, who prosecuted the first case.Defense attorneys for Knox and Sollecito are expected to present their final arguments early next week.Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial. A third defendant, Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate fast-track trial.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 63, "end": 66, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 240, "end": 244, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 367, "end": 371, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1200, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1265, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1692, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1754, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1955, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2555, "end": 2559, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2628, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2860, "end": 2864, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 3180, "end": 3193, "mot": "Stefano Conti", "types": ["person", "collector"], "type": ["collector"]}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3405, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 3753, "end": 3757, "mot": "Gino", "types": ["actor"], "type": []}, {"start": 3843, "end": 3847, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4013, "end": 4029, "mot": "Giuliano Mignini", "types": ["lawyer"], "type": []}, {"start": 4083, "end": 4087, "mot": "Knox", "types": ["minister", "theologian"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 4352, "end": 4360, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"minister": 15, "theologian": 15, "company": 2, "person": 1, "collector": 1, "actor": 1, "lawyer": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/24/world/europe/italy-knox-appeal/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110924093339-amanda-knox-court-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-24T08:35:17Z"}, {"id": "be53760e-e94b-5ba0-9ce5-791a687dd7f4", "title": "CEO of loss-hit UBS bank resigns", "content": "CEO of loss-hit UBS bank resignsBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1507 GMT (2307 HKT) September 24, 2011 Story highlightsThe board at UBS has accepted Gruebel's resignationIt follows the recent revelation by UBS of a $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized tradingA UBS trader faces charges in connection with the lossesThe head of Swiss banking giant UBS has resigned in the wake of a $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized trading, the bank announced Saturday.Chief executive Oswald J.

Mostly young onlookers could be seen waving, chanting, singing and occasionally shedding tears as Benedict approached the colorfully decorated stage.With the opening line of his sermon, the pope triggered resounding cheers and applause from the crowd, which held up a sea of ritual candles. \"Dear young friends,\" Benedict said, \"I have been looking forward all day to this evening to be here with you and to pray and fellowship with you,\" the last words of the sentence almost inaudible over the cheers.The pope's sermon revolved around the light of the candles and was followed by artistic performances.Earlier in the day, more demure crowds had packed into the quaint, historic center of the city of Erfurt to listen quietly as the pontiff delivered a solemn sermon on freedom from Nazi and Communist dictatorships.  \"Yes, we really have a reason to thank God wholeheartedly,\" Benedict said with reference to Germany's attainment of freedom and democracy. Erfurt is located in the country's east, which after the fall of the Nazi regime endured a Communist dictatorship, ironically named the German Democratic Republic (GDR).  It fell in 1989.But the pontiff also bemoaned German's long-standing trend of turning away from the Christian faith since gaining greater political freedom.\"The majority of people in this country live far away from a belief in Christ and from the community of the church,\" the pope said in his sermon. Catholic and Lutheran denominations alike have lost membership, but for decades German attrition hit the Protestant Church harder.Disenchantment with the Roman Catholic Church has grown in the wake of the global sex scandal involving Catholic clergy.  The pope met Friday at a seminary in Erfurt with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy and church personnel in Germany.Benedict also met with people \"who care for those injured by these crimes,\" according to a statement from the Vatican press office.\"Moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims, the Holy Father expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families,\" the statement added. \"He assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children.\"The pope has had similar meetings elsewhere, in the face of outcries from many nations in Europe, North America and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases.Friday's visit was unique in that it took place in the homeland of Benedict, where he'd also served as a cardinal. He himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case, when he -- as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the transfer of a man within Germany in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children. But the archdiocese has said the then-cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man's case. In March 2010, the priest -- then identified only as H -- was suspended, the archdiocese of Munich and Freising announced.Five years earlier, enthusiasm was high in Germany's Catholic community when Benedict was named pope. But the sex abuse scandal, and a perception that a conservative church is unlikely to change its ways, has affected the church in the European nation.According to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the scandal broke. And candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference.While he has visited Germany three times since 2005, this marks Benedict's first state visit as pope.On Thursday, he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulf. He also gave a speech before the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, in which he spoke of the \"inviolable dignity of every single human person.\"Benedict began his day Friday with a mass in Berlin and met with 15 representatives of Germany's Muslim community. In a subsequent speech, he said, \"the convictions (Catholics and Muslims) are becoming visible\" while adding that \"constant effort is needed in order to foster better mutual acquaintance and understanding.\"\"There can be a fruitful collaboration between Christians and Muslims,\" Benedict said in the speech, a transcript of which was provided by the Vatican. \"We can offer an important witness in many key areas of life in society (such as) the protection of the family based on marriage, respect for life in every phase of its natural course or the promotion of greater social justice.\"The pope is scheduled to meet Sunday with federal judges from Germany's constitutional court and with German bishops in Freiburg before flying back to Rome in the evening.Powered by

decline, in a systemic crisis\" a decade ago.\"By our common efforts we've managed to preserve and restore our beloved fatherland, our Russia. And we will not give it back to anyone,\" he said.\"We will not give it back to those who want to destroy it, to those who deceive people by giving them empty and unfeasible slogans and promises.\"In his own speech, Putin said it was a great honor to run for president and that his voice of command \"is not lost.\"He said he wanted to see economic growth in Russia increase to 6-7% in the near future. In the next five years, Russia should be among the five most powerful economies in the world, he said.Putin also set out the task of fully rearming the Russian armed forces in the next five to 10 years.Putin said he was sure the United Russia party, whose election ticket will be headed by Medvedev, would win December's parliamentary elections.Medvedev would \"be able to build a new, efficiently-functioning and young team of managers, and lead the government so as to continue modernization of all aspects of our lives,\" Putin added.For more than two years, Putin and Medvedev have repeatedly said they would decide together which of them would run for the Russian presidency in 2012, fanning the flames of intrigue. Even during his time as prime minister, Putin has been widely perceived as the senior member of the Russian \"ruling tandem.\" Putin had stepped down in 2008 because the Russian constitution at that time limited a president to two consecutive four-year terms.Under amendments to the constitution that came into force on December 31, 2008, the presidential term was extended to six years.This means that if Putin is elected in March 2012 for six years, he would be eligible to run for another six-year term after that, potentially keeping him in charge until 2024. Under the same constitutional amendments the term for parliament members was extended from four to five years.Currently, the United Russia controls more than 300 seats in the 450-seat State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian parliament. More than 10,000 people attended the party congress, held in Moscow's Luzhniki Sports Arena.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 24, "end": 29, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 65, "end": 68, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 241, "end": 246, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 321, "end": 326, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 528, "end": 543, "mot": "Dmitry Medvedev", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["president"]}, {"start": 565, "end": 578, "mot": "United Russia", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 620, "end": 634, "mot": "Vladimir Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 657, "end": 662, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1403, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1490, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1622, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1731, "mot": "Vladimir Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1974, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2456, "end": 2461, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2801, "end": 2813, "mot": "armed forces", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 2870, "end": 2883, "mot": "United Russia", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 3164, "end": 3169, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3206, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3400, "end": 3405, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3485, "end": 3490, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3764, "end": 3769, "mot": "Putin", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 4047, "end": 4060, "mot": "United Russia", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 4266, "end": 4274, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"politician": 17, "company": 2, "president": 1, "party": 3, "force": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/24/world/europe/russia-putin/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110924095024-putin-medvedev-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-24T09:44:16Z"}, {"id": "bafb76f8-eb81-55fb-bad4-1392b3b7b834", "title": "Guards fired at outside area of Pope's Mass in Germany", "content": "Guards fired at outside area of Pope's Mass in GermanyFrom Frederik Pleitgen, CNNUpdated 1132 GMT (1932 HKT) September 24, 2011 Pope Benedict celebrates Mass on Saturday in Erfurt, eastern Germany.Story highlightsNo one was injured, police say, and one person is in custody The incident takes place \"several hundred meters away\" from the Mass venueTwo private security company workers were shot at with an air gun near where Pope Benedict was to hold Mass in Germany on Saturday, police said.Four shots were fired, but no one was injured,  Dirk Sauter, a spokesman for Erfurt police said in a statement.One person has been taken into custody. \"The incident happened at a security check at the outer perimeter of the security zone\" for the pope's Mass, Sauter said.

victory over Freiburg under interim coachDefending champions Borussia Dortmund eighth after away victoryBayern Munich remained two points clear at the top of the German Bundesliga table after a comprehensive 3-0 win at home to last season's runners-up Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.Germany international Thomas Muller opened the scoring in the fifth minute from Franck Ribery's cross, and Belgium defender Daniel van Buyten doubled the lead with a fierce low shot before 20 minutes were played.Dutch winger Arjen Robben sealed the victory at the end after coming on as a 78th-minute substitute on his return from injury to keep Bayern in form ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit by big-spending English club Manchester City, making it six wins out of seven.The defeat left Leverkusen, who host Belgian club Genk in Europe's top club competition on Wednesday, down in 10th place.Borussia Moenchengladbach briefly went top with a 1-0 victory at home to mid-table Nuremberg, as captain Filip Daems scored the only goal from the penalty spot with 14 minutes left after Marco Reus was fouled.Schalke claimed fifth place after a 4-2 victory at home to Freiburg under the guidance of interim coach Seppo Eichkorn, with Ralf Rangnick having stood down for health reasons.The visitors led in the third minute through Papiss Demba Cisse, but Jefferson Farfan equalized on 33 and second-half goals from Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, young forward Lewis Holtby and veteran Spaniard Raul made Erik Jendrisek's 83rd-minute strike against his former club a mere consolation.Hanover missed the chance to move into top three after being held 0-0 at third-bottom Augsberg, who have still yet to win in seven games since winning promotion.Defending champions Borussia Dortmund moved up to eighth with a 2-1 victory at Mainz, as a last-minute volley from Poland international right-back Lukasz Piszczek ended their run of seven away games without a win ahead of Wednesday's trip to Marseille in France.Nicolai Muller opened the scoring in the 33rd on his full debut for Mainz, but young Croatia midfielder Ivan Perisic leveled on 64.Wolfsburg overcome the

after scoring his third goal during Barcaleona's 5-0 win over Atletico Madrid.Story highlightsBarcelona move up to second in Spain with 5-0 win at home to Atletico MadridLionel Messi scores a hat-trick to take his tally to eight league goals this seasonCristiano Ronaldo also nets treble as 10-man Real Madrid triumph 6-2Sevilla claim third place above Real with 1-0 victory over ValenciaBarcelona and Real Madrid have roared back to form ahead of next week's Champions League challenges, with the Spanish giants recording comfortable victories in La Liga on Saturday.Barca's title defense has been uncharactistically unconvincing so far, with last Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Valencia their second dropped points in four outings.But Pep Guardiola's team responded by crushing Atletico Madrid 5-0 on the day the club confirmed a historic five-year shirt sponsorship with a Qatari group and also banned smoking at the Camp Nou stadium.The Catalan club's financial problems have led members to accept 171 million euros ($230 million) from Qatar Sports Investment, with 697 out of 809 delegates voting to end a longstanding tradition of no commercial shirt endorsements.Having reported a loss of 9.3 million euros ($12 million) in 2010-11, the board has projected a 20.1 million euros ($27 million) profit for this season.Guardiola started with key defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique on the bench against Atletico, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League trip to BATE Borisov of Belarus.The visitors' five-goal new striker Falcao was unable to take advantage -- but at the other end Argentine scoring machine Lionel Messi took his league tally to eight this season with a superb hat-trick.Tiago Mendes crashed an early shot off the Barca crossbar, but David Villa settled home nerves in the ninth minute and it was 2-0 six minutes later when Joao Miranda unluckily ricocheted a blocked shot from Messi into his own net.With rain pouring down, Messi notched his first of the night in typical style as he jinked into the box from the right flank and curled home at the near post in the 26th minute for his 190th goal in 278 games for Barca.Atletico held out until the final 12 minutes when Messi provided two more moments of solo artistry as Barca moved up to second in the table -- a point behind Real Betis, who travel to Getafe on Monday.The two-time world player of the year matched the efforts of Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who also netted a treble in the earlier 6-2 thrashing of Rayo Vallecano.Real's title challenge has also faltered, first with a 1-0 defeat by Levante and then the midweek 0-0 draw with Racing Santander, and Jose Mourinho's team suffered a horror start at home when Michu scored after just 14 seconds.Ronaldo leveled seven minutes before halftime after being set free on the counterattack by Kaka, and Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in injury-time with a simple finish after Sergio Ramos headed Xabi Alonso's freekick across the goal.Ronaldo made it 3-1 from the penalty spot when Kaka was fouled five minutes after the break, but Real were then reduced to 10 men when winger Angel Di Maria was sent off after being booked a second time for handball.Michu capitalized in the 54th minute with his second from a corner, stabbing a shot across the line despite keeper Iker Casillas' best efforts to drag it back out.Teenage defender Raphael Varane made it 4-2 in the 67th minute, with the 18-year-old Frenchman somehow volleying in a corner with the back of his foot.Karim Benzema drove in Real's fifth on 73 after a square pass from fellow substitute Mesut Ozil, whose first-half introduction in place of Lassana Diarra swung the match in Madrid's favor.Ronaldo completed his second hat-trick this season with six minutes to play, chipping in a penalty after being fouled.Real's third win in five outings lifted Mourinho's men into fourth place ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit by Dutch side Ajax.In Saturday's other games, third-placed Sevilla joined Barcelona on 11 points with a 1-0 win at home to Valencia as striker Fredi Kanoute scored the only goal in the 18th minute.Valencia dropped to fifth behind Real Madrid on goal difference.Athletic Bilbao moved out of the bottom three with a 1-1 draw at home to Villarreal, with Brazilian striker Nilmar netting a second-half equalizer for the visitors.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 10, "end": 17, "mot": "Ronaldo", "types": ["forward"], "type": []}, {"start": 33, "end": 38, "mot": "Barca", "types": ["association", "club"],

This is the right spirit.\"Former Juventus, Roma, Chelsea and Valencia boss Ranieri replaced Gian Piero Gasperini, whose tactics proved both unpopular and unsuccessful in his short five-game tenure.The 59-year-old's next task is to kickstart Inter's Champions League campaign in Tuesday's trip to Russia to face CSKA Moscow, following the opening defeat by Turkey's Trabzonspor.He will again be without key Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder, whose injury is \"worse than first thought.\"Inter bounced back from Tuesday's 3-1 defeat by promoted Novara as striker Giampaolo Pazzini netted the opening goal six minutes before halftime when new signing Diego Forlan and Esteban Cambiasso combined to set him up.Alessandro Diamanti leveled with a penalty in the 66th minute after Walter Samuel fouled Daniele Portanova, but substitute Milito restored the lead with nine minutes to play from the spot after he fell under contact from Archimede Morleo.Morleo was sent off, and Inter took full advantage as defender Lucio headed in a freekick by Sulley Muntari with three minutes to go. AC Milan moved up to eighth place with a much-needed 1-0 victory at home to bottom club Cesena -- the first in the league this season for the Serie A champions.Veteran Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf scored the only goal in the fifth minute to boost coach Massimiliano Allegri ahead of Wednesday's Champions League visit to the Sna Siro by Czech titleholders Viktoria Plzen.In Saturday's other match, Fiorentina drew 0-0 at Napoli to leave both teams in a group of five on seven points at the top of the table.Genoa, who lead on goal difference, travel to Chievo on Sunday while second-placed Juventus visit Catania and Udinese travel to Cagliari.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 37, "end": 48, "mot": "Inter Milan", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]},

Webb Simpson, who leads the FedEx standings, was tied for 19th after his 70 -- which dropped him below Scott in the projected points. He bounced back from four early bogeys with a late birdie and an eagle.\"I've got to win and I imagine Webb must have to finish pretty low to give me a chance,\" Scott, who birdied the last two holes for the second day in a row, told the PGA Tour website.

F1 title beckonsBy Updated 1646 GMT (0046 HKT) September 24, 2011 Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel celebrates after finishing first during qualifying on Saturday.Story highlightsSebastian Vettel wins his 11th pole position of 2011 at Singapore Grand GrixGerman heads home Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in Saturday qualifyingVettel is hoping to secure his second world title in 14th of 19 races this seasonFerrari's Fernando Alonso can deny him by finishing fourth in the night raceSebastian Vettel is on track to become Formula One's youngest double world champion after topping the qualifying timesheets for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix.The 24-year-old headed off Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to claim his 11th pole position this season as he seeks a ninth victory from 14 races.That would give him another championship crown -- the first was clinched at the last race of 2010, but this one would be with five to go as he seeks to build on his 112-point lead in the night event.Vettel can beat the mark of second-placed Fernando Alonso, who was 25 when he won his second title with Renault in 2006.But the Spaniard could delay Vettel's celebrations if he finishes fourth on a testing Marina Bay Street Circuit where he led from the start to win last year from Vettel and Webber -- and also triumphed with Renault in 2008.How the F1 title can be won: Vettel on the vergeAlonso will have to improve on Saturday's qualifying, where he was fifth fastest ahead of Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa.Red Bull team boss Christian Horner downplayed chances of the title being decided this weekend.\"The moon and stars have got to line up. We haven't booked anything for a party should we win. We're focused on the race,\" he told reporters in quotes carried by AFP.Vettel set the pace in the first two sessions before clocking an unbeatable one minute 44.381 seconds in his only run of Q3 to give Red Bull a perfect record in qualifying this season.Vettel fastest in Singapore practice\"I decided to abort my second run when I made a mistake because it is very  easy to damage the car so I went wide,\" he said.\"I was quite happy with my first lap. I think the circuit ramped up at the end and I think it was possible to go faster, but I'm very happy. It's a very difficult track with such a long lap to get everything right. I think we learned from our mistakes that we made last year.\"Webber then surged into second with 1:44.732 to push past McLaren's former world champions Jenson Button (1:44.804) and Lewis Hamilton (1:44.809).Hamilton was unable to make a second run due to a fuel problem, and watched from the pits as his time was beaten.Alonso timed 1:44.874 to be well clear of Massa (1:45.800) and the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg -- whose legendary teammate Michael Schumacher failed to set a time along with Force India's Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta -- who both opted to conserve tires.Powered by Livefyre",

EvertonThird-placed Chelsea beat Swansea as Fernando Torres scores and is sent offNewcastle retain fourth place as Demba Ba scores hat-trick against BlackburnManchester United's perfect start to the English Premier League season came to a halt on Saturday when the defending champions were held to a 1-1 draw at Stoke City.United had won five matches in a row, and took the lead through a superb individual goal from midfielder Nani in the 27th minute as the Portugal international waltzed into the box and drilled in a low shot.However, the industrious home side never gave up and claimed a point against the 19-time English champions for the first time in the Premier League thanks to a 52nd-minute header from big-money August signing Peter Crouch.The lanky former Tottenham striker got between central defenders Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand to nod home from a corner as United goalkeeper David De Gea was left helpless on his line.United went into the match without England striker Wayne Rooney, who wrote on Twitter that he expects to return from injury for Tuesday's Champions League visit by Swiss side Basel.His regular forward partner Javier Hernandez is a doubt for that match after coming off in the first half against Stoke having fallen hard on his head when he tumbled following a tussle with Jonathan Woodgate as the Mexican sought to score.That left United with last season's top scorer Dimitar Berbatov up front alongside Michael Owen, who scored twice in midweek in the League Cup but failed to make the same impression.JUST WATCHEDTheo Walcott on Arsenal's

difference.City earlier briefly topped the table as second-half goals from substitutes Mario Balotelli and James Milner ended Everton's run of victories in their last four visits to Eastlands. Balotelli broke the deadlock in the 68th minute after replacing Edin Dzeko, with his shot taking a deflection off Everton defender Phil Jagielka.The Italian then set up David Silva, whose effort was ruled out for offside -- and the Spanish playmaker also earlier hit the woodwork.Silva provided City's second with a minute to play as he sent England midfielder Milner clear after an error by Everton's former Real Madrid winger Royston Drenthe, who came on as a substitute.Balotelli's return to form will give manager Roberto Mancini a selection dilemma ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Bayern Munich.Meanwhile, Fernando Torres was both hero and villain as third-placed Chelsea beat promoted Swansea 4-1.The Spain striker scored his second goal in two games after a long drought to put the London side ahead on the half hour, but was sent off before halftime for a bad tackle on Mark Gower -- his first red card in the Premier League.It was another mixed weekend for the $80 million former Liverpool player, who also netted in the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United before an extraordinary miss that saw him widely lampooned.Ramires had already made it 2-0 before Torres departed, and the Brazil midfielder doubled his tally in the 76th minute before Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed in Gower's freekick.Substitute Didier Drogba sealed victory deep into stoppage time to boost his hopes of starting in Wednesday's Champions League trip to Valencia.Newcastle retained fourth place with a 3-1 victory over Blackburn, who remained in the relegation zone.Senegal striker Demba Ba scored his first hat-trick in English football before being replaced by France midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his league comeback after almost a year out with a broken leg.Fifth-placed Liverpool bounced back from the 4-0 trouncing at Tottenham by beating mid-table Wolverhampton 2-1 at home.Charlie Adam was sent off last weekend but this time his 11th-minute shot produced an own-goal by defender Roger Johnson, and striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 before halftime.Substitute striker Steven Fletcher gave Wolves hope four minutes after the break, but Kenny Dalglish's team held on as England midfielder Steven Gerrard continued his comeback from long-term injury when he was introduced late in the match.Tottenham closed to within a point of Liverpool, having played one fewer match, after a 2-1 win at Wigan.New signing Emmanuel Adebayor set up Dutch midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart in just the third minute, then Gareth Bale headed home Luka Modric's 23rd-minute corner to make it 2-0.Striker Mohamed Diame reduced the deficit five minutes after halftime but Wigan defender Steve Gohouri was sent off for a second booking for a foul on winger Bale as Spurs held on for a third successive victory.Arsenal moved out of the relegation zone and up to 12th place with a 3-0 win over 10-man Bolton that left the visitors rock bottom after five successive defeats.Robin van Persie's second-half double gave the Dutch forward 100 goals for the London club, while Alex Song curled home late on.Bolton had defender David Wheater sent off with the score at 1-0 after tugging back England forward Theo Walcott, who later limped off.West Brom and Fulham remained in the bottom four after a 0-0 draw at the Hawthorns which left the visiting London side still

alleged victims of phone hacking by journalists has confirmed that he plans to launch legal action in the United States against media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.Mark Lewis told CNN Friday he expects an initial hearing to be held in New York in about two to three months, as he seeks to begin legal claims in the United States. This summer's scandal around claims of phone hacking by journalists working for the now-defunct News of the World -- run by News International, the British arm of News Corp. -- rocked public confidence in the media, police and politicians.Police in London are now investigating the hacking claims as well as allegations of bribery of police.Senior News Corp. executives have denied that wrongdoing among the company's staff was widespread. Separately, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has filed a lawsuit against News Corp., his lawyer, Jo Rickards, confirmed to CNN Friday.

He denies knowledge of wrongdoing while he was editor.He is among a dozen people to have been arrested and released on bail by police investigating claims that many celebrities, politicians and victims of crime had their phones hacked.  Lewis' clients include the family of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked before she was found murdered. Public outrage over the allegations led News International to shut down News of the World in July.\"We have been speaking to U.S. lawyers to make applications to U.S. courts in order to assist the investigation of this matter and are looking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offence is said to have taken place,\" Lewis said. \"Proceedings will be issued in the U.S. where we will seek information from the company's directors about those issues and about corporate governance.\"This action was being pursued \"because it is in our clients' interests to pursue their cases as thoroughly and properly as possible,\" Lewis said.  He added that \"compensation is likely to be higher from U.S. courts than courts in the UK.\"John Kelly, a lawyer at Schillings law firm, which represents Steve Coogan and other suspected celebrity hacking victims, told CNN its clients have not yet joined the lawsuit against News Corp. in the United States but are interested in the idea.Another lawyer for a number of alleged hacking victims, Mark Thomson, told CNN his clients were pursuing claims in the English civil courts but did not intend to take action in U.S. courts.Earlier this week, a News International statement confirmed it was involved in \"advanced negotiations with the Dowler family regarding their compensation settlement.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 42, "end": 51, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 66, "end": 69, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 147, "end": 163, "mot": "News Corporation", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 204, "end": 216, "mot": "Andy Coulson", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 248, "end": 257, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 282, "end": 292, "mot": "Mark Lewis", "types": ["creator"], "type": []}, {"start": 671, "end": 685, "mot": "Rupert Murdoch", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 714, "end": 717, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 988, "end": 1006, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1036, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1221, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1360, "mot": "Andy Coulson", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1398, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1442, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1539, "mot": "Murdoch", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1610, "mot": "Murdoch", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1808, "mot": "David Cameron", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["minister"]}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2206, "mot": "Milly Dowler", "types": ["person"], "type": []}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2354, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2900, "end": 2920, "mot": "corporate governance", "types": ["executive"], "type": []}, {"start": 3160, "end": 3170, "mot": "John Kelly", "types": ["general", "secretary"], "type": ["general"]}, {"start": 3222, "end": 3234, "mot": "Steve Coogan", "types": ["actor", "producer", "comedian"], "type": ["producer"]}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3290, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3343, "end": 3352, "mot": "News Corp", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3481, "end": 3484, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3634, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3772, "end": 3780, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 16, "journalist": 2, "creator": 1, "leader": 3, "politician": 1, "minister": 1, "person": 1, "executive": 1, "general": 1, "secretary": 1, "actor": 1, "producer": 1, "comedian": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/23/world/europe/uk-us-phone-hacking/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110923034837-news-corporation-headquarters-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-23T15:41:04Z"}, {"id": "5d78ec0e-7ffb-5c4f-8682-c17b0e603858", "title": "Vettel fastest in Singapore practice", "content": "Vettel fastest in Singapore practiceBy Updated 1407 GMT (2207 HKT) September 25, 2011 Title leader Sebastian Vettel prepares to go out in Friday's practice in his Red Bull.Story highlightsSebastian Vettel sets fastest time in free practice for Sunday's Singapore Grand PrixVettel two-tenths of a second quicker than closest title rival Fernando Alonso of SpainGermany's Vettel can clinch world championship with victory in the night raceLewis Hamiton of Britain third quickest in his McLaren Championship leader Sebastian Vettel continued his domination of the Formula One season by setting the fastest time in Friday's practice for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix.The Red Bull star can clinch his second straight F1 title with victory in Sunday's night race and set about the task by clocking the best lap of one minute 46.374 seconds in the second session.Closest rival Fernando Alonso took second fastest, ahead of McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, who was quickest in the morning runs.

CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider.\"I was surprised, shocked,\" by the findings, Antonio Ereditato, Opera spokesman at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told CNN. \"However, we are confident in what we did and we think we did it correctly.\"We concluded after a long scrutiny of all systematic uncertainties that we could not explain (the result) otherwise.\"The 150 or so researchers on the Opera project will continue their research, he said, but now they want the worldwide scientific community to come up with \"new ideas to explain or new experiments which should -- could -- confirm or disprove the effect.\"The finding would seem to challenge Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, and the long-established law of physics that nothing can exceed the speed of light.\"It is very, very remarkable if it's true,\" said Professor Neville Harnew, head of particle physics at Oxford University.\"If this proves to be correct, then it will revolutionize physics as we know it.\"Early universe revealed at 4 trillion degreesJUST WATCHED2010: Particle collider's woesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2010: Particle collider's woes 00:59He will be among scientists from around the world tuning into a webcast seminar held by CERN Friday afternoon, to discuss what Harnew describes as an \"ultra-exciting\" development that has come \"totally out of the blue.\"The Opera team's result is based on the observation of more than 15,000 bunches of neutrinos sent between CERN and the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy. A neutrino is an electrically neutral subatomic particle, an elemental building block of the universe.The physicists say the measurements of the distance and the time involved were performed with great precision, to nanosecond accuracy.And the results seemed to show the neutrinos travel \"at a velocity 20 parts per million above the speed of light, nature's cosmic speed limit.\"Professor James Stirling, head of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, said part of what is so surprising is that \"the effect is so large, relatively speaking\" -- that is, that the particles traveled a significant degree faster than should have been possible.\"This is a violation of this speed of light limit,\" he said. \"This is really a result that would challenge one of the cornerstones of the whole of physics.\"Sergio Bertolucci, research director at CERN, said the Opera team followed good scientific practice by throwing open their findings to other scientists.\"When an experiment finds an apparently unbelievable result and can find no artifact of the measurement to account for it, it's normal procedure to invite broader scrutiny,\" he said.\"If this measurement is confirmed, it might change our view of physics, but we need to be sure that there are no other, more mundane, explanations. That will require independent measurements.\"Ereditato said more research is needed -- and that the Opera team wants to be prudent for now because of the apparent magnitude of their finding.\"The potential impact on science is too large to draw immediate conclusions or attempt physics interpretations,\" he said in a CERN news release. \"My first reaction is that the neutrino is still surprising us with its mysteries.\"Harnew told CNN the new finding \"cannot currently fit in the standard theories at all\" and would have to be confirmed by another experiment -- to ensure there is no subtle systemic error at play -- before a discovery can be claimed.And he cautions that \"neutrino measurements are extremely difficult experiments,\" making it hard to verify results independently.Neutrinos, which are emitted during the process of radioactive decay, have only a tiny mass and usually pass through matter without interacting with anything else, making them very hard to detect.CERN is one of only a handful of laboratories capable of running an experiment like the Opera project, Harnew said. Other possible sites could be J-Parc in Japan, home of the multinational T2K project, and Fermilab in Illinois.Stirling also wants to see more experiments to replicate and test the results, but predicts that theoretical physicists will struggle to write papers on such a revolutionary finding.It was only recently discovered that neutrinos, which come in three types, can switch from one type to another -- thereby proving that they have mass, Stirling said.If they can indeed travel faster than mass-less particles, like light, then these mysterious particles will have done even more to turn the world of physics on its head.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 1143, "end": 1147, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1210, "mot": "Large Hadron Collider", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1316, "mot": "Bern", "types": ["school"], "type": []}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1341, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1840, "mot": "Albert Einstein", "types": ["physicist"], "type": []}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2022, "mot": "Neville", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2076, "mot": "Oxford University", "types": ["university"], "type": []}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2383, "mot": "webcast", "types": ["person"], "type": []}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2404, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2641, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 3071, "end": 3085, "mot": "James Stirling", "types": ["explorer", "admiral"], "type": ["explorer"]}, {"start": 3099, "end": 3119, "mot": "Cavendish Laboratory", "types": ["university", "institute"], "type": ["university"]}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3143, "mot": "Cambridge University", "types": ["university"], "type": []}, {"start": 3489, "end": 3506, "mot": "Sergio Bertolucci", "types": ["scientist"], "type": []}, {"start": 3529, "end": 3533, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3693, "mot": "unbelievable", "types": ["television_program"], "type": []}, {"start": 4286, "end": 4290, "mot": "CERN", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 4400, "end": 4403, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 5091, "end": 5097, "mot": "J-Parc", "types": ["building"], "type": []}, {"start": 5151, "end": 5159, "mot": "Fermilab", "types": ["institute"], "type": []}, {"start": 5699, "end": 5707, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"institute": 8, "facility": 1, "school": 1, "company": 3, "physicist": 1, "politician": 1, "university": 3, "person": 1, "explorer": 1, "admiral": 1, "scientist": 1, "television_program": 1, "building": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/23/world/europe/switzerland-science/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110923090554-shubert-uk-neutrinos-00000616-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-23T08:40:39Z"}, {"id": "00608ef7-3c6c-5de6-81ef-6cc0e5b2ee9c", "title": "Tour Championship leader Bradley enjoying Atlanta return", "content": "Tour Championship leader Bradley enjoying Atlanta returnBy Updated 1524 GMT (2324 HKT) September 23, 2011 Rookie Keegan Bradley clinched the PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club last month.Story highlightsKeegan Bradley holds a two-shot lead after the first round of the Tour ChampionshipJason Dufner, who lost to Bradley at the PGA Champioship, is tied for secondLuke Donald is also second, and on course to win the FedEx Cup seriesWorld No. 1 would be the first man to top both PGA and European Tour money listsKeegan Bradley is looking forward to another tussle with Jason Dufner at the lucrative Tour Championship this weekend in Atlanta, where he defeated his fellow American in a playoff to win his first major title.The rookie is seeking to follow up his surprise success at the PGA Championship six weeks ago, and made the perfect start to the $10 million FedEx Cup series finale at East Lake by taking the first-round lead with a six-under-par 64 on Thursday.

Creamer claims two points for the United States from losing positions Europe survived a late rally from the United States to hold a slender one-point lead after the first day of the Solheim Cup in Ireland Friday.After sharing the opening foursomes 2-2, Europe looked set to take a commanding lead in the afternoon fourballs until the three-time defending champions limited their losses after trailing in all four matches.Europe will take a 4 1/2 to 3 1/2 lead into Saturday's matches at Killeen Castle Golf Club in County Meath with Norway's Suzann Pettersen and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden playing a pivotal role.They paired together in the morning foursomes for a last-hole win and then secured afternoon victories with different partners.2010 U.S. Open champion Paula Creamer was equally influential for the U.S as she and Brittany Lincicome won the final two holes to  defeat Melissa Reid and Karen Stupples by one hole in the morning.It was a repeat act in the fourballs, one down after 16 with Morgan Pressel against Reid and Laura Davies, Creamer made a dramatic winning birdie putt on the 17th and saw her partner drain an 18-foot putt for another winning birdie at the 18th.What you

biennial team competition.\"Both matches could prove vital. I was one down with two to play and going down the 17th told my partners 'we're not going to lose'. Even half a point can  be huge so to win two was massive,\" she told AFP.World No.2 Pettersen was also in the mood for late heroics, holing a birdie putt on the final green to win her foursomes with Gustafson and then joined Anna Nordqvist in a superb final hole win over Cristie Kerr and Michelle Wie.\"I had two great partners and it has been a great day's team effort,\" said Pettersen, the world No.2 and a veteran of six Solheims.In the fourballs, Gustafson helped Caroline Hedwall to a crushing 5 and 4  win over Vicky Hurst and Lincicome.Catriona Matthew, the 2009 Women's British Open Champion, was also in fine form, winning her foursomes with Spain's Azahara Munoz  and adding a half point in the fourballs with Sandra Gal of Germany.They led Christina Kim and rookie Ryann O'Toole two up with three to play, but Kim holed a massive birdie putt at the short 16th and O'Toole made a 25-foot putt at the 17th as the honors were shared..

Her dazzling collection of jewels, many of which were given to her as presents by husbands including Richard Burton and Mike Todd, were referred to Friday in London by Jonathan Rendell, Deputy Chairman of Christie's Americas, as \"the crown jewels of Hollywood.\"Fans of the screen idol can now ogle highlights from her extensive jewelry collection, along with a selection of her haute couture dresses by designers including Chanel and Christian Dior, and paintings by artists such as Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro, at Christie's auction house in London.They are being exhibited there as part of a world tour that will culminate in a series of high-profile sales at Christie's in New York in December.  Taylor's jewel collection has been valued in excess of $30 million, according to the auction house.JUST WATCHEDElizabeth Taylor's jewels in LondonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHElizabeth Taylor's jewels in London 02:30Keith Penton, head of the jewelry department at Christie's in London, said that Taylor's taste in jewels was \"extraordinarily refined. She really understood her gemstones ([and)she had a passion for design and workmanship, quite a rare combination.\"And not only do they speak of her infamous and tempestuous romance with actor Richard Burton, he said, the jewels come with their own dramatic histories -- such as a 50-carat pearl known as \"La Peregrina,\" given to her by Burton in 1969, that was once part of the crown jewels of Spain.It was mounted onto a specially commissioned diamond and ruby Cartier necklace and is estimated to fetch between $2 million and $3 million at auction in December.  There is also the Taj Mahal diamond pendant necklace, which Burton gave her on her 40th birthday in 1972 and which had been a gift from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to his wife in the 17th century. \"If a jewel had a historic provenance, they were particularly enamored,\" said Penton of the pair's taste in gems. According to Nancy Schoenberger, co-author of the book \"Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, The Marriage of the Century,\" Taylor developed a taste for jewels from a young age.\"Her father was an art and antiques dealer,\" Schoenberger explained. \"She grew up surrounded by beautiful things and was always drawn to jewelry as a young girl,\" she said. But it wasn't until Taylor's marriage to film and Broadway producer Mike Todd that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold, Schoenberger said. Todd, her third husband, bought Taylor a 29.4-carat diamond ring as well as a diamond tiara, which she wore to the 1957 Academy Awards. Schoenberger believes that when Richard Burton bought Taylor the 33.19-carat Krupp Diamond ring in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at Christie's, estimated to fetch between $2.5 million and $3.5 million -- he was trying to out-do Mike Todd, who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with Taylor. \"I think that was a big deal for Richard, to buy her a diamond as big as Mike Todd's. And he liked showing that the son of a Welsh coal-miner could buy his lady love these extravagant jewels,\" she said.Penton believes that the collection will induce feverish bidding in the salesroom, for the quality of the collection but also for their added Hollywood glamor.\"Judging from past sales, which have never been as spectacular as this one -- I think the sky's the limit,\" he said. The actress, who died this year aged 79, eulogized her love of gems in her 2002 memoir, \"My Love Affair With Jewelry.\"In it, she wrote: \"I never, never thought of my jewelry as trophies. I'm here to take care of them and to love them. When I die and they go off to auction I hope whoever buys them gives them a really good home.\"At a press conference on Friday, Rendell of Christie's said that the collection reveals \"one of the great characters, this was one of the great stars, this was someone who understood her contract with the public.\"Penton agreed and said, \"Looking at the couture, you can see that she was not a very large lady but obviously with the hair, with the presence, with the glamor, it all added up to something very fabulous.\" In memory of the actress's life-long devotion to humanitarian causes, a portion of profits generated by admissions, events and select publications related to the sales will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF), which she set up in 1991.

abuse victims in Germany", "content": "Pope 'deeply shaken' in meeting with sex abuse victims in GermanyBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 0233 GMT (1033 HKT) September 24, 2011 Pope Benedict XVI gives a blessing during a vesper service in Etelsbach, Germany, on Friday.Story highlightsPope Benedict XVI meets with victims of clergy abuse in his native GermanyHe \"expressed his deep compassion and regret,\" the Vatican reportsIt is his first state visit to Germany, which included meetings with top officialsThe pope also pushed for \"a fruitful collaboration\" with Muslims Pope Benedict XVI met Friday with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy in his native Germany, where disenchantment with the Roman Catholic Church has grown in the wake of the scandal.The meeting, which occurred at a seminary in Erfurt, came on the second day of the pontiff's four-day visit to his homeland. Besides talking with victims of sexual abuse committed by priests and church personnel, he also met with people \"who care for those injured by these crimes,\" according to a statement from the Vatican press office.\"Moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims, the Holy Father expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families,\" the statement added. \"He assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children.\"The pope has had similar meetings elsewhere, in the face of outcries from many nations in Europe, North America and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases.Friday's visit was unique in that it took place in the homeland of Benedict, where he'd also served as a cardinal. He himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case, when he --  as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the transfer of a man within Germany in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children. But the archdiocese has said the then-cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man's case. In March 2010, the priest -- then identified only as H -- was suspended, the archdiocese of Munich and Freising announced.Five years earlier, enthusiasm was high in Germany's Catholic community when Benedict was named pope. But the sex abuse scandal, and a perception that a conservative church is unlikely to change its ways, has affected the church in the European nation.According to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the scandal broke. And candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference.While he has visited Germany three times since 2005, this marks Benedict's first state visit as pope.On Thursday, he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulf. He also gave a speech before the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, in which he spoke of the \"inviolable dignity of every single human person.\"Benedict began his day Friday with a mass in Berlin and he met with 15 representatives of Germany's Muslim community. In a subsequent speech, he said, \"the convictions (Catholics and Muslims) are becoming visible\" while adding that \"constant effort is needed in order to foster better mutual acquaintance and understanding.\"\"There can be a fruitful collaboration between Christians and Muslims,\" Benedict said in the speech, a transcript of which was provided by the Vatican. \"We can offer an important witness in many key areas of life in society (such as) the protection of the family based on marriage, respect for life in every phase of its natural course or the promotion of greater social justice.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 72, "end": 75, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 133, "end": 150, "mot": "Pope Benedict XVI", "types": ["politician",

arrested on the resort island of MallorcaSpanish authorities say he was attempting to recruit for al QaedaA Cuban man arrested in Spain this week for alleged ties to al Qaeda was released Friday on provisional liberty, but must report daily to police, a National Court spokeswoman told CNN.The 24-year-old suspect, identified only by his initials J.E.F.M., was released after a 45-minute closed-door arraignment before Judge Fernando Andreu at the National Court, which handles terrorism cases.The court-appointed defense lawyer, Francisco Fernandez Castan, told CNN after the hearing that he argued for all charges to be dropped, saying that police allegations the Cuban had incited terrorism through internet postings was in fact just an example of \"freedom of expression.\"But the judge maintained the charges of alleged links to al Qaeda, while police further analyze the suspect's various portable computers, external hard drives and USB memory sticks that were seized at the time of his arrest on Spain's Mallorca island Tuesday, said the court spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.The suspect was accompanied by two uniformed police officers outside the judge's chambers, and at times was handcuffed. He wore a black T-shirt, dark ankle-high blue jeans and gray sandals.The judge's order requires him to report daily to the police station nearest his home in Cala Rajada, on the northeast side of Mallorca, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the island's capital, Palma de Mallorca.The Interior Ministry said in a statement that he was wanted for alleged membership in al Qaeda and had 1,120 radical videos on the Internet, mostly produced by him, and that he used the internet for the radical indoctrination of other individualsAuthorities have been investigating the suspect since last year, the ministry statement said. Civil Guards detained him for allegedly recruiting and indoctrinating others for the terrorist group and for distributing public messages aimed at provoking terrorist attacks, the statement added.Spain's Balearic archipelago in the Mediterranean is a popular tourist resort for Spaniards and others from Europe, with large contingents of Britons and Germans visiting or residing there.Since the Madrid train bombings of 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others, Spanish police have arrested more than 400 suspected al Qaeda militants or collaborators, the Interior Ministry website says.

The inaugural tournament, bearing Solheim's name, was held in 1990 at the Lake Nona club in Florida. Two teams of eight players faced each other, with the American side running out  comfortable winners 11 1/2 to 4 1/2.In 1996 the tournament was increased to 12 players per side, a number that stands to this day and it has become the leading team event in women's golf, with players earning their place either through their own tour money lists, or as a captain's pick -- exactly the same as in the men's Ryder Cup.There have been 11 tournaments in total, with the United States leading 8-3, but the European team have not won any of the six competitions played on American soil.The football-loving legend:No look at the Solheim Cup can be taken without mentioning Laura Davies. Quite astonishingly, the Englishwoman, who turns 48 next month, has appeared in all 11 previous tournaments and, once again, she is a member of the European team at Kileen Castle.Davies is a phenomenon in women's golf. As well as her achievements on the course -- which include winning four majors amongst her 81 victories -- she has been a flag-bearer for promoting the game, most notably when, in 2004, she became the first woman to compete on the men's European Tour.Davies is sports daft and is a keen racehorse owner as well as an avid follower of Liverpool Football Club. However, her love of football got her into trouble with tournament organizers in the 1996 Evian Masters, when she was fined for watching a match on a portable TV during the final round of that tournament.It didn't seem to hamper her game -- she won that particular tournament by four strokes!Swedish legend Annika Sorenstam appeared in eight Solheim Cups, winning 22 of her 37 matches, while compatriot Sophie Gustafson, another member of the current side, and European captain Alison Nicholas have also starred in eight tournaments.As for the Americans, you have to look hard to find a bigger legend than Juli Inkster. Despite reaching the age of 51 to become the oldest-ever competitior, the Californian is once again facing the European  side this year, her ninth appearance in the event.Breaking the mould:The Solheim Cup has never really seen a player like Christina Kim before. Not only is the 27-year-old Californian a lucky charm for the United States, appearing in the winning teams of 2005 and 2009 -- claiming five out of eight points in the process -- her infectious personality, undiluted enthusiasm, larger-than-life character and wacky dress sense has been a highlight of recent competitions.Kim is known for her bawdy sense of humor and occasional bouts of bad language that occasionally land her in hot water with golfing authorities.Describing her fist-pumping celebrations in the 2009 Solheim Cup, former LPGA star Dottie Pepper wrote in a column for Sports Illustrated: \"I know Christina Kim loves the galleries and is a ham, but she should be a little more respectful of the game. In the NFL, she would have been given 18 excessive celebration penalties.\"Despite becoming the youngest-ever player to reach $1 million in career earnings, Kim has not won on the LPGA Tour since 2005 and last year her autobiography,  \"Swinging from My Heels: Confessions of an LPGA Star\", was released to critical acclaim.Chaos and controversy:Don't be deceived by the genteel nature of women's golf. The passion and will-to-win is as high as the men, but that spilled over into acrimonious scenes in 2003.The Barseback Golf and Country Club in Malmo, Sweden provided the setting for the eighth Solheim Cup and the first to be played away from either the United States or Great Britain.Scotland's Catriona Matthew secured victory for Europe on the 17th green, resulting in wild scenes of celebration.However, there were still quite a few singles matches still out on the course, including Norway's Suzann Pettersen against  American Cristie Kerr.An excited Pettersen incurred Kerr's wrath by encouraging the crowd to make more noise in celebration as Kerr was about to putt on the 15th green.Kerr missed the putt and Pettersen won the hole. But, sensing her opponent's annoyance, Pettersen turned to Kerr on the 16th green and conceded the match, before joining the European celebrations.The same thing happened between the aforementioned Laura Davies and opponent Meg Mallon on the 14th hole but, as the match was all square, the pair both walked up to the tournament referee to concede at the same time, causing confusion.The Beth Daniel-Mhairi McKay match also came to an abrupt end with the score in the balance resulting in American captain Patty Sheehan telling reporters: \"I have never seen that before. All of a sudden, everyone just quit. It wasn't quite right.\"Trophy on trophy:Appropriately enough, as the tournament is in Ireland this year, the Solheim Cup trophy is made of Waterford Crystal glass, which originates just down the coast from the Killeen Castle resort.The urn-shaped trophy is 19 inches high, weighs more than 20 pounds and sits atop a wooden base.It was designed in 1990 for the inaugural tournament, but what makes it unusual is an engraving of the trophy on the trophy -- a panel on one side of the crystal is engraved with the Solheim Cup logo, and the logo incorporates the trophy itself.Following the men:The competition is now a complete mirror image of the men's prestigious Ryder Cup, involving the same amount of players, format, points on offer and rivalry.But with the American team bidding for a fourth successive victory, the pressure is on for the Europeans to stop the rot, especially as another defeat will increase the clamor for the tournament to be changed to allow Asian players to compete.Asian golfers rule the roost in the women's game, with six of the world's top 10 players coming from the continent.In 1979, worried by the one-sided nature of the competition, Ryder Cup organizers decided that their biennial competition between the United States and Great Britain should be altered to make it Europe instead of Britain.The change completely altered the nature of the event, making it closer and more exciting. Another American victory, taking their overall lead to 9-3, will certainly intensify that particular debate.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/23/sport/golf/golf-solheim-cup-explainer/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110923060817-golf-christina-kim-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-23T18:33:53Z"}, {"id": "ae8f4cb3-a1ba-54b6-90b4-b4b224969021", "title": "F1 title race: Vettel on the verge of retaining crown", "content": "F1 title race: Vettel on the verge of retaining crownBy Updated 1551 GMT (2351 HKT) October 6, 2011 Hide Caption 1 of 4 Photos: Battle on for Button \u2013 McLaren's Jenson Button is the only man who can stop Vettel claiming a second drivers' championship.

You have to, nothing flies for ever. I think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage, the target going into this weekend is not to get one point, in a way it's not to win the championship, the target is to do our best.\"Yes, there would be reason to celebrate, even if we finish tenth, but it wouldn't be the same so we try to race as usual and we try to get the best out of ourselves.\"When asked what the secret behind his success was, Vettel's answer was simple: \"Probably a word that is not at first sight that fancy, consistency.  And in this respect we have had a terrific year so far and I hope it will not desert us for the final races.\"The climax to the 2011 season is in stark contrast to last year's finale, when Vettel leaped from third position heading into the final race at the Yas Marina Circuit to overhaul teammate Mark Webber and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso to claim glory.\"Going into the last race and being some points behind is a completely different situation to leading the standings by a gap of 124 points,\" said Vettel, who was 15 points adrift of first-place Alonso heading into November's final race in the gulf kingdom. \"What I try to do is not to listen to all these statistics and simply focus on this race, as I always do with every single race -- which has served me well. I have learned from the mistakes that I made in the past and it would be foolish to make them again, so don't wait to see them here. \"It is not embarrassing making mistakes if you learn from them, but it would be embarrassing making the same mistakes all over again. \"Button signs new multi-year deal with McLarenButton was cautiously optimistic regarding his chances in Suzuka, but admitted the circuit is one which would suit Red Bull's RB7 car.\"I think it will be a great race for everyone,\" said Button, who recently signed a new deal with English-based McLaren. \"In the last few races, I think we've shown that we have extremely good pace and that we've been the team most able to take the fight to Red Bull. \"On paper, I think it's a circuit that will suit the Red Bulls, particularly in the high-speed sweeps that make up the first sector of the track, but I certainly don't think people should under-estimate our package.\"We showed at Spa that we have a car that's very effective in high-speed corners. We've also improved our straight-line speed and we have a more efficient rear wing for qualifying, so I think we're feeling positive about the weekend.\"If Vettel fails to clinch the championship this weekend, the title race would roll on to the Korean Grand Prix on October 16.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 151, "end": 158, "mot": "McLaren", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 468, "end": 486, "mot": "Michael Schumacher", "types": ["diplomat", "ambassador"], "type": ["ambassador"]}, {"start": 794, "end": 802, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1067, "mot": "Japan", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1466, "mot": "Michael Schumacher", "types": ["diplomat", "ambassador"], "type": ["ambassador"]}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1711, "mot": "Renault", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1778, "mot": "Toro Rosso", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2069, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2684, "end": 2694, "mot": "The moment", "types": ["album"], "type": []}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3444, "mot": "The climax", "types": ["movie"], "type": []}, {"start": 3582, "end": 3592, "mot": "Yas Marina", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 3638, "end": 3645, "mot": "Ferrari", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 4545, "end": 4553, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 4556, "end": 4559, "mot": "RB7", "types": ["car"], "type": []}, {"start": 4675, "end": 4682, "mot": "McLaren", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 4821, "end": 4829, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 5416, "end": 5424, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"manufacturer": 4, "diplomat": 2, "ambassador": 2, "team": 6, "album": 1, "movie": 1, "facility": 1, "car": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/23/sport/motorsport/motorsport-f1-sebastian-vettel/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110922050320-sebastian-vettel-22-9-11-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-23T13:22:11Z"}, {"id": "bb587c3e-393d-5166-9ed5-3e8e1309e81f", "title": "Football: United reject Hargreaves claims", "content": "Football: United reject Hargreaves claimsBy Updated 2220 GMT (0620 HKT) September 23, 2011 Owen Hargreaves played nearly an hour for Manchester City in his debut on Wednesday.Story highlightsManchester United have hit back at former midfielder Owen HargreavesHargreaves claimed he had been mistreated by the club's medical staffThe England midfielder spent four injury-plagued years at Old TraffordHargreaves recently joined United's archrivals Manchester CityManchester United have hit back at Owen Hargreaves after their former midfielder claimed he had been mistreated by the English champions' medical staff.Hargreaves, who joined United's archrivals Manchester City in August after his contract at Old Trafford expired, was reported in the British press as having said he felt like a guinea pig during an injury plagued four-year spell with the Red Devils.The England midfielder was speaking after making a goal-scoring debut for City in their 2-0 Carling Cup win over Birmingham City on Wednesday.\"Manchester United is disappointed with Owen Hargreaves' remarks after the game on Wednesday,\" read a statement on the three-time European champions' website.What are the reasons behind Man Utd's flying start?\"The club gave him the best possible care for three years and is as disappointed as anyone he was not able to play a part in the team's success at that time. \"It has shared all the medical records with Manchester City and is comfortable with the actions taken by its medical staff at each step of his many attempts at rehabilitation.\"The Canada-born star arrived at United from German outfit Bayern Munich in 2007, but only made 27 appearances for Alex Ferguson's team due to persistent injury problems relating to the tendons in his knee.\"They said I would be fit for the start of pre-season but, after that, I never got back on my feet,\" Hargreaves was reported as saying in British newspaper The Guardian. \"My tendon was never the same. They said my tendon was good, but it felt like I was made out of glass.\"We treated it and it got significantly worse through the injections. That obviously had a huge impact. Basically, I was left to pick up the pieces, which was incredibly frustrating.

Prosecutors in the case are presenting their concluding arguments as to why the appeals court in the Italian town of Perugia should uphold the convictions for Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Rafael Sollecito, after a lengthy appellate process.Addressing the jurors, appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola said: \"I hope when you make your decision, you feel a little bit like the parents of Meredith Kercher, a serious, studious girl whose life was taken away by these two kids from good families.\"Defense attorneys for Knox and Sollecito are expected to present their final arguments early next week, as they fight to overturn the convictions.  Knox and Sollecito were found guilty in 2009 of killing Kercher, Knox's British housemate, two years earlier.

Were they distracted? Or didn't they find anything wrong?\" he asked the court.Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito have in recent weeks sought to undermine their convictions by scrutinizing DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Kercher and on her bra clasp.Two independent forensic experts argued this summer that the Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be \"inadmissible\" because the clasp had not been properly handled. Prosecutors rejected that claim.Knox's father, Curt, told CNN earlier this month that prosecutors have \"no case left,\" after a review of evidence, and that he hoped to be able to take his daughter home within weeks.Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial.

which begins at the Killeen Castle Golf Resort in Ireland on Friday.The competition, an exact replica of the men's Ryder Cup, begins on Friday morning with four foursomes, where the players alternate playing the same ball, before the afternoon's four fourballs -- which sees each player playing their own ball.Saturday's two sessions then follow exactly the same format, before Sunday's 12 individual singles, which will determine the winners.With a total of 28 points up for grabs, the winning team is the first to reach 14 1/2 points, with the Americans securing 16-12 triumphs in Illinois in 2009 and Sweden in 2007.Alison Nicholas, who is captaining Europe for a second time following their 2009 defeat, has paired Maria Hjorth and Anna Nordqvist in the opening foursomes match -- with the Swedish duo lining up against Michelle Wie and Cristie Kerr.The English duo of Karen Stupples and Melissa Reid face Paula Creamer and Brittany Lincicome in the second of the foursomes, while the third sees veteran Scot Catriona Matthew and Spanish rookie  Azahara Munoz against Stacy Lewis and Angela Stanford.And Friday's morning session is completed by Suzann Pettersen of Norway and Sweden's Sophie Gustafson facing Brittany Lang and Juli Inkster -- who becomes the oldest-ever Solheim Cup player at the age of 51.The United States lead Europe 8-3 overall and both Nicholas and her American counterpart Rosie Jones are aware of the need to get a good start in the competition.Nicholas told the official Solheim Cup website: \"I think I have a good blend in my team and I am very happy with the way the draw has worked out.\"Catriona, for instance, is a great leader and gets on so well with everyone. She has lots of experience and I think she will make a great pairing with Azahara. They are both steady players.\"The United States come into the match as favorites to retain their title, with four of the world's top 10 amongst their ranks.\"I've put Michelle and Cristie out first because they are both good leaders,\" Jones told the official website. \"They have played a lot together and had success. I want them to get out there and put up a point.\"She continued: \"I've got heavy hitters in every match. I have a master plan and I'm going to stick to it as much as possible.

Gasperini at Inter Milan", "content": "Ranieri replaces Gasperini at Inter MilanBy Updated 2113 GMT (0513 HKT) September 22, 2011 Inter Milan are the 12th club of Claudio Ranieri's 24-year coaching career.Story highlightsInter Milan have appointed Claudio Ranieri as their new coachRanieri arrives just 24 hours after Gian Piero Gasperini exited the clubInter have made a winless start to the Italian Serie A seasonRoma and Siena are still without a win after drawing 1-1 on ThursdayVeteran coach Claudio Ranieri has been given the chance to restore Inter Milan's fortunes following the short, unsuccessful tenure of Gian Piero Gasperini at the Italian club.Ranieri has previously been in charge of big European teams such as Juventus, Chelsea, Valencia, Atletico Madrid and Napoli, but has been out of work since leaving Inter's Serie A rivals Roma in February after a run of poor results.He takes over a team in turmoil, with Gasperini sacked on Wednesday following a 3-1 defeat by newly-promoted Novara -- Inter's second in three league matches. Gasperini, 53, is the only coach in Inter's history to leave without winning a game.The three-time European champions also lost to archrivals AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup and to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor in the Champions League group stage opener.\"Claudio Ranieri has officially become the new coach of Inter. He has signed a contract binding him to the club June 30, 2013,\" Inter's official website reported on Thursday.JUST WATCHEDInter Milan manager sackedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInter Milan manager sacked 02:52\"Everyone at F.C. Internazionale has the pleasure of welcoming Claudio Ranieri and his staff and wishing them well.\"Ranieri, whose only major managerial honors are the 1996 Italian Cup with Fiorentina and 1999 Spanish Cup at Valencia, said he wants to improve the current squad's mentality.\"I think I will need to talk a lot with the squad, the mental aspect is very important,\" the 59-year-old told Italian television channel RAI Sport. \"Inter are a great team. We have to pick up the pace after this false start. The players are there and we have everything to lift the team. Gasperini had every right to try to execute his ideas; he tried to make his system work with all his strength, but without success.\"I do not think he can be criticized, he tried to implement his ideas until the end. For me, every system can bring victories -- if Inter have always played in a specific way, there must be a reason.\"Known as the \"The Tinkerman\" from his time at Chelsea when he constantly rotated his team, Ranieri refused to make any promises of success this season as Inter seek a 19th Serie A crown.\"I do not like to promise things. I want the best from these players, who have so much to give.\"His appointment means that Inter have now had four different coaches since current Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho left the San Siro in May 2010.Mourinho guided Inter to a historic treble, which included a first European Cup in 35 years, before being replaced by the Spaniard Rafael Benitez after leaving for the Bernabeu stadium.Benitez, who led Liverpool to Champions League success in 2005, was sacked in December 2010 despite taking Inter to victory at the FIFA Club World Cup.Former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Benitez and guided Inter to a second-place finish in Serie A last season, before his move to France's Paris St. Germain as director of football led to ex-Genoa boss Gasperini being appointed in June.Ranieri's first match in charge of his new team will be Saturday's league trip to Bologna.Meanwhile, the one Serie A match played on Thursday saw Roma and Siena draw 1-1 at the Olympic Stadium.Daniel Osvaldo put Roma ahead in the 25th minute when he tapped home Marco Borriello's pull back .But the visitors levelled with just two minutes remaining when Roberto Vitiello netted from a rebound after Franco Brienza's effort crashed against the post.The result means both sides are still waiting for their first victory of the season, having drawn two of their opening three games. In Spain, an injury time goal from Walter Pandiani gave Espanyol a 1-0 success over Getafe, who have now lost threee successive Primera Liga matches.

Cup seriesStandings leader Webb Simpson wants to maintain his recent impressive formWorld number one Luke Donald can also win the $10 million jackpotBritish golfer Justin Rose has targeted glory in this weekend's money-spinning Tour Championship in Atlanta as the next step on the road to capturing a first career major.Rose, 31, won the BMW Championship on Sunday to qualify for the 30-man FedEx Cup decider, knowing that victory at East Lake will guarantee him the $10 million bonus prize on offer at the final event of the four-tournament playoff series.There's also the $1.44 million purse for winning a tournament long considered to be golf's unofficial \"fifth major\" after the Masters, the British and U.S. Opens and the PGA Championship.The South Africa-born Rose is not just targeting short-term success, as he looks to continue on a path which began with him turning professional after finishing tied for fourth as a promising young amateur at the 1998 British Open.\"The progression of my career has been slow at times, but I feel like I'm on the right track,\" Rose told CNN.JUST WATCHEDTour Championship: Golf's big payday ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTour Championship: Golf's big payday  02:38\"Last year was a big year for me, winning twice on the PGA Tour and winning two good tournaments. I think this year winning a playoff event is another step up the ladder.\"The next step for me is a World Golf Championship and a major. I feel like it could happen at any time. I seem to play well on tough courses, I seem to play well against strong fields, so hopefully that bodes well for the majors.\"Rose, third in the FedEx Cup standings, is one of five players who know they will walk away with the bumper jackpot if they emerge victorious on Sunday.\"That's a nice position to go in on, knowing that if you can do the business and you can pull off a great win, you control your own destiny and the FedEx Cup will be yours,\" the world No. 17 said.\"You're not relying on anybody else out here. For me, it's a situation that I didn't foresee being in a week ago.\"Seven days ago Rose was ranked 34th in the standings and in danger of missing the cut for the final FedEx Cup series event ahead of the BMW Championship.But he rallied to clinch an all-important triumph at Cog Hill, his third on the PGA Tour -- a win which Rose credits to minor adjustments to his game.\"I had a good lesson with my coach on the Tuesday, just adjusted a couple of things with my caddy, the way we go about things. I simplified the process out there on the golf course,\" he said.\"Instead of having so many numbers rattling around in my head, we simplified it down to one ... which I think was a calming influence. It just really got me focusing on the shot much better.\"Rose and the other FedEx Cup hopefuls will be chasing Webb Simpson, the American who propelled himself to the top of the pile with a playoff win over compatriot Chaz Reavie at the Deutsche Bank Championship.\"One thing that we're trying not to do is relax,\" Simpson, who has won two events in the last 16 days, told a press conference. \"It's a relaxing environment: no cut, 30 guys, big purse, a great golf course.

But if Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Israeli club's supporters received any trouble from the people of Turkey last week, it was only on the football pitch. After a 5-1 trouncing at the hands of Istanbul's Besiktas, Maccabi safely returned to Tel Aviv the next day as concerns that the team and its fans would be in danger proved unfounded.The Europa League match appeared to be a perfect convergence of sports and politics, coming as relations between Israel and Turkey reached an all-time low. Less than two weeks before the match, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expelled the Israeli ambassador over the Middle Eastern country's refusal to apologize for a naval commando raid on the SS Mavi Marmara, on which nine Turkish activists were killed as they made their way to the blockaded Gaza Strip. Days later, Turkey broke off military ties with Israel -- and Jerusalem announced the formation of a naval alliance with Greece, Turkey's historical enemy. Erdogan has since threatened to deploy Turkish warships to escort the next Gaza Flotilla and to increase Turkish naval presence in the Eastern Mediterranean to counter Israeli \"bullying practices\" in the area.Turkey quickly became a state where Israelis no longer feel welcome, just as Maccabi Tel Aviv headed to Istanbul for a match against a team renowned for having some of the wildest fans in Turkish soccer. JUST WATCHEDTurkey vs. Israel in footballReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTurkey vs. Israel in football 01:46Elif Batuman, a regular contributor to The New Yorker and a writer-in-residence at Koc University, described the Besiktas squad as \"the more working-class team.\"\"Of the three main Istanbul teams, Besiktas is kind of the underdog. They have the least money, the most run-down stadium,\" she said. \"With the other two big Istanbul teams (Galatasaray and Fenerbahce), the stadiums don't have any particular ties to their neighborhoods, and the fan bases are more spread out. They call themselves the neighborhood team, the people's team.\" Ahead of a talk on Turkish soccer at an art gallery in central Istanbul the day before the match, Batuman described Besiktas supporters as being tied not only to the neighborhood but also, to some extent, to a political way of life. \"They're the most political of the soccer teams: they support Greenpeace, they do blood drives, they're environmentalists. They're definitely not pro-American, the ones I've talked to, but they say they don't dislike Americans, only American policy. They are also definitely not pro-Israel and they support the Palestinians.\"He said the match against Maccabi, the most successful club in Israel, was \"clearly seen as a rallying event.\"The Israeli media aired reports that Maccabi players who serve in the Israel Defense Forces reserves were banned from taking part in the game out of fear for their safety. The report turned out to be false, but was in keeping with a general sense in Israel that the team was heading straight into the lion's den at the worst possible moment, prompting calls for the game to be canceled or forfeited. By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Besiktas fans began pouring into a square in the heart of their neighborhood, a short walk from the stadium. Cheering and downing copious amounts of Efes Pilsen beer, they locked arms and sang about the evils of the hated Fenerbahce and the beauty of all that is Besiktas. Those Besiktas supporters spoken to at the pre-game drink-up did not appear to have the Gaza Strip or the Mavi Marmara on their minds, and were completely indifferent to the presence of an Israeli reporter scribbling on a notepad in their midst.\"We hate Fenerbahce, not Israel,\" said Kazim, a student from Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, who also said he did not believe the war of words between the Turkish PM and Netanyahu gave the game any extra meaning. Kemal Yuksel, a student at the Istanbul Technical University said the Besiktas fans are \"just interested in football, not politics.\"\"We live for Besiktas and it doesn't matter what country you're from -- we want to beat you,\" he said. \"Israel isn't our problem, it's the country's problem. Every Besiktas game is crazy, doesn't matter if we play Maccabi or anyone else.\" At the same time that the Besiktas fans were pounding pre-game lagers, a crowd of around 200 people marched from Taksim Square in central Istanbul to the Inonu stadium, vowing not to forget or forgive the Mavi Marmara incident. Wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the pictures of the nine Turkish activists and with some protesters carrying flags of the Lebanese Shi'ite militia Hezbollah, they made their way towards the stadium without arrest or incident. The protest was a repeat of sorts of a smaller gathering held the night before outside the Divan hotel where the Maccabi players were staying. A crowd of about 20 people waving Palestinian flags stood in silence across from the hotel for a couple of hours before filing away into the night. Meanwhile, a block further down the street past the Divan hotel, three street-walkers of unclear gender plied their wares, drawing slightly more interest from passersby than the nearby anti-Israel protest.Like everywhere else the Maccabi players traveled during their visit, the Divan was under heavy police protection. Outside the hotel, two armored police vans were parked at the ready, with officers in front of the vehicles with sub-machine guns. Around a dozen other police officers stood in formation next to the vans, but were not wearing riot gear. Next to the vehicles, a police sedan idled, while a single officer napped in the front seat. The heightened security continued inside the stadium, where dozens of riot police circled the field and plainclothes police and security officials kept a constant watch on the event.Once the match kicked off, it took only three minutes for Besiktas forward Hugo Almeida to put his team on the board with the first of his two goals. Maccabi answered soon after halftime through forward Roi Kehane, but the visitors never threatened again and Besiktas rolled to a 5-1 victory before a raucous home crowd. The 12 hardy Maccabi Tel Aviv fans who attended the game, protected by at least 20 police per head, were seated in the fenced-off visitors' section, which was book-ended on the left and right by two sections of empty seats patrolled by stadium security. One of those Israeli fans who made the trip to Istanbul was Israel Mukhtar, 45, who was in town on his first-ever trip abroad with the Maccabi squad. \"We went all around the markets and the nightclubs [in Istanbul] and we told everyone we were Israeli. No-one gave us any trouble whatsoever,\" Mukhtar said, adding \"all of the security was well done and we never felt a threat for a second, I didn't even see a single Palestinian flag.\"Mukhtar and his friends, nearly all of whom were middle-aged men who seemed to know each other prior to the trip, said the danger inherent in the match was overblown by the Israeli media. They praised the professionalism of Turkish security forces, and expressed their feelings that the diplomatic tension between the two countries is on the upper levels of their respective government, and not reflected in a visceral hatred from people on the streets of Turkey's largest city -- as opposed to Cairo, for instance, where a mob ransacked the embassy a week earlier forcing the Israeli staff to flee in drag under evacuation by Egyptian commandos.Even with the final score of the match reflecting an on-field massacre of the Israeli visitors, Mukhtar said he was not disappointed by his decision to attend the match. \"To be honest, it made me proud to be Israeli. To know that out of 6 million people (in Israel), you're one of only 12 who was willing to come ... I think it means something.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/22/sport/football/football-turkey-israel-besiktas-maccabi/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110921023330-besiktas-fans-outside-2-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-22T10:31:58Z"}, {"id": "c603b72c-3a92-5dc1-a9ec-50cee5f9e0c7", "title": "UK to compensate families over 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre", "content": "UK to compensate families over 1972 Bloody Sunday massacreFrom Peter TaggartUpdated 1212 GMT (2012 HKT) September 22, 2011 Members of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign march on June 15, 2010 in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Story highlightsThe Ministry of Defence says it acknowledges the pain felt by familiesBritish troops shot dead 13 people and a 14th later died of his injuriesA report last year found that British soldiers were to blame in the massacreBloody Sunday is widely accepted as having fueled violence in Northern IrelandThe British government said Thursday it will pay compensation to the relatives of those killed and wounded by British soldiers in the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland in 1972.Thirteen people died when British troops opened fire at a mainly Catholic civil rights march in Londonderry, and another man died four months later of injuries sustained on that day.Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron described what happened in Londonderry as \"unjustified and unjustifiable,\" following the release by the British government of a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings. The paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims, gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far-reaching official inquiry into the seminal event, the inquiry concluded. The independent Saville Report was a comprehensive rejection of the British government's official account of the killings, which had stood for 38 years. Lawyers representing the affected families wrote to Cameron demanding compensation.The families now say Britain's Ministry of Defence has replied, saying it wants to \"resolve the compensation question as quickly as possible.\"\"We acknowledge the pain felt by these families for nearly 40 years, and that members of the armed forces acted wrongly. For that, the government is deeply sorry,\" a spokesman for the ministry said Thursday.   \"We are in contact with the families' solicitors and where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we will do so.\"However, the relatives of one of the victims -- 19-year-old William Nash -- say they want the soldiers involved to be prosecuted for murder and will not accept the compensation. The relatives branded the British government offer \"repulsive\" and said they would not accept a payment \"under any circumstances.\"Bloody Sunday is widely accepted as fueling support for the IRA (Irish Republican Army) during the early years of what became known as The Troubles -- 30 years of violence between pro-British and pro-Irish forces.  Even the name of the city where it happened is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry.The IRA, a republican paramilitary organization, is listed by the British Home Office as a proscribed terrorist group. The Troubles claimed about 3,000 lives over a three-decade period, with 1972 the single bloodiest year.The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party has called for IRA victims to be compensated by the British government.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 414, "end": 421, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 542, "end": 549, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 648, "end": 655, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 750, "end": 757, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 932, "end": 945, "mot": "David Cameron", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1057, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1402, "mot": "The independent", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1462, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1599, "mot": "Cameron", "types": ["politician", "minister"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1870, "mot": "armed forces", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2168, "mot": "William Nash", "types": ["soldier"], "type": []}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2307, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2467, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2551, "mot": "The Troubles", "types": ["operation", "war"], "type": ["war"]}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2777, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 2844, "end": 2855, "mot": "Home Office", "types": ["agency", "department"], "type": ["department"]}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2901, "mot": "The Troubles", "types": ["operation", "war"], "type": ["war"]}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3029, "mot": "Ulster Unionist Party", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 3045, "end": 3048, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3089, "mot": "British", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3112, "end": 3120, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"unit": 8, "politician": 2, "minister": 2, "newspaper": 1, "force": 4, "soldier": 1, "operation": 2, "war": 2, "agency": 1, "department": 1, "party": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/22/world/europe/ireland-uk-compensation/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110922120018-bloody-sunday-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-22T11:46:35Z"}, {"id": "c9c94992-a05b-597e-987b-e945636af0b0", "title": "Series of blasts kill 1, injure dozens in Russia's Dagestan ", "content": "Series of blasts kill 1, injure dozens in Russia's Dagestan By Maxim Tkachenko, CNN Updated 1033 GMT (1833 HKT) September 22, 2011 Story highlightsThe blasts target police officersTwo blasts occur within 15 minutes of each otherIn another attack, gunmen shoot at a district police chief in Dagestan A series of attacks against police hit the Russian North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Thursday, killing several officers and injuring dozens more, authorities said.An unidentified person set off a bomb equivalent to about 3 kilograms (more than 6 pounds) of TNT shortly after midnight near the police headquarters in the regional capital of Makhachkala.No one was hurt, the local police department reported on its website.Fifteen minutes later, when investigators arrived at the scene, a more powerful car bomb went off, killing a police officer. It injured 39 people, including 32 officers, police said.Dagestan police said on its website that the second bomb had the power of 35-40 kilograms  of TNT. The Russian Interior Ministry reported on its website that the blast killed one police officer and injured 60 people, including 44 officers.An investigation will be conducted,  the Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement.\"Shops and residential buildings in the epicenter of the explosion were either damaged or completely destroyed,\" it said.Also Thursday morning, attackers in a car shot at  a district police chief in the Dagestani city of Buinaksk .Col. Magomednabi Adilkhanov was not injured, but two of his bodyguards were killed, local police reported.  A day before the attack on the police chief,  three men died in a car explosion in Makhachkala. Police said the initial investigation suggests they mishandled a bomb during its transportation.Several security officers were reported killed in Dagestan last week, as well as a mosque imam. Following Russia's two bloody wars in Chechnya against Islamist separatists in the 1990s, the militant insurgency spilled onto other neighboring regions in the area.Dagestan is the largest and most volatile of the five Northern Caucasus regions. Rebels continue to stage frequent attacks on security forces, police and civilians, placing it at the center of the insurgency. Last month, the head of the Federal Security Service Alexandr Bortnikov told the Russian president that in the first six months of this year, 169 terrorist acts were committed, of which 110 took place in Dagestan. Ninety-five law enforcement officers died in those attacks, he said. In the same time period, Bortkinov said, security officers arrested 400 rebels and their accomplices, and killed 250 more.

But a new exhibition in Florence is showing just how intertwined the two really were. Entitled \"Money and Beauty: Bankers, Botticelli and the Bonfire of the Vanities,\" the exhibition in Florence's Palazzo Strozzi looks at how Florence's famous families got rich -- and how they then used their wealth to commission works from some of the world's most celebrated artists.According to the Palazzo's Director General James Bradburne, the idea for the show had been in development since 2006, but it would be another two years before it was cemented as a particularly apt exploration of the city's history.    \"September 2008 rolls around and we're talking about the development of the show and Lehman Brothers goes bust, which made the whole idea very timely,\" he said. The show's trajectory takes in the birth of the Medici bank and its use of relatively new financial systems, including letters of exchange (an ingenious type of lending that managed to get around usury laws by changing foreign currencies and profiting on exchange rather than interest rates), right up to its collapse at the end of the 15th century. Included in the show are paintings by Sandro Botticelli, who had a close relationship with the Medicis, as well as paintings of the new mercantile class and their novel activities by artists such as Dutch painter Marinus van Reymerswaele. And gold -- whether in the form of coins or the golden halos hovering over depictions of the holy family -- is one of the exhibition's dominant themes and materials. The exhibition is curated by English writer Tim Parks, author of \"Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence,\" and Ludovica Sebregondi, an Italian art historian and author of \"Iconography of Girolamo Savonarola, 1495 -1998.\" Both show how the bankers, worried that their activities might be contravening their religious beliefs, poured money into building churches and commissioning devotional paintings -- often with themselves inserted into them. \"The bankers were never quite sure whether (the letter of exchange) was usury of not, a lot of theologians said it was and a lot of theologians said it wasn't,\" Parks explained.\"So you have a situation where these bankers, who were often very devout men, were making penitential gestures towards the church just in case,\" he said. The influence of their new wealth, he said, is evident in the paintings of the holy family, where the Virgin is frequently depicted wearing sumptuous Florentine clothes and the artists use significant amounts of gold. \"You could say that some of these gestures were simply penitential, but then the banker begins to realize that in giving them money he can also begin to define the image that is produced by his money, and of course one of the things he instinctively does, whether it's conscious or not, is to use the image to change the attitude to money, that is, begin to use the image to undermine the resistance to money,\" said Parks. Money was feared, he said, not only because Christianity espoused poverty but crucially because it allowed for social mobility and therefore undermine the set Medieval hierarchies. Still, for a few years, the Medicis were in charge of papal finances. And, said Parks, the artists were often happy to oblige in order to ensure their own economic prosperity. Sebregondi, for her part, doesn't believe that the artworks commissioned necessarily spoke of cynicism on the part of the patrons or the artists. \"Patrons wanted works of art to highlight their wealth and their power, but the beauty aspect allowed them to \"purify\" their money, to shake off the vulgarity and the sense of sin that has always been associated with it,\" she said. Regardless of their efforts, there was a backlash, personified at the end of the 15th century by the preacher Girolamo Savonarola, who railed against the lavish lives of the rich and encouraged artists such as Botticelli to throw their works onto \"bonfires of the vanities.\"The exhibition ends with a section on Savonarola and includes the turbulent, later paintings of Botticelli, who Sebregondi believes was tormented by \"emotional anguish.\" It was a tumultuous time, said Bradburne, with some echoes of our current predicament. \"It is not a coincidence, any more then than now, that wealth and the investment in certain kinds of expression of wealth are related,\" he said. \"One might say (the banker's money) basically funded the Renaissance,\" Sebregondi concluded.

Many see the papal itinerary as an encroachment on church-state separation; others in the increasingly secular nation are critical of the church's more conservative teachings.Several organizations and politicians protested in Berlin. Robert Kastl, the organizer of a large demonstration, slammed the pope's speech Thursday at the Reichstag, saying \"no religious leader should speak in the German parliament.\"About 6,000 police officers are providing security for the visit.JUST WATCHEDA papal homecoming for Benedict XVIReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA papal homecoming for Benedict XVI 01:25First on the pontiff's itinerary was a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff, in which they discussed the global financial situation, among other issues.Later, in his speech at the Reichstag, Benedict asserted that European culture \"arose from the encounter between Jerusalem, Athens and Rome (...). This three-way encounter has shaped the inner identity of Europe.\"\"In the awareness of man's responsibility before God and in the acknowledgment of the inviolable dignity of every single human person, it has established criteria of law. It is these criteria that we are called to defend at this moment in our history.\"Enthusiasm in Germany abounded when then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected pope in 2005, but in the years since, disenchantment with the church has taken hold in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal and the perception that an increasingly conservative Catholic Church is unlikely to change its ways.Stark numbers illustrate the difficulty the pope faces in mending fences in his homeland:-- According to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the child abuse scandal broke.-- Candidates for the priesthood have dropped 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference.-- In a poll for Stern magazine, 86% of Germans said they thought the papal visit was unimportant.Also on Thursday, the pope was to meet with representatives of the Jewish community at the Reichstag and conduct Mass at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. On Friday he is scheduled to meet in Berlin with representatives of the Muslim community and the German Evangelical Church Council. He then will travel to Efurt for an ecumenical celebration in the church of the Augustinian Convent, and then to Etzelsbach for Marian Vespers at the Wallfahrtskapelle, a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary.The four-day state visit ends on Sunday.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 115, "end": 132, "mot": "Pope Benedict XVI", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 169, "end": 174, "mot": "Tegel", "types": ["airfield"], "type": []}, {"start": 224, "end": 232, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 453, "end": 459, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 556, "end": 573, "mot": "Pope Benedict XVI", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 994, "end": 1009, "mot": "Bellevue Castle", "types": ["building", "house"], "type": ["house"]}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1301, "mot": "Tegel", "types": ["airfield"], "type": []}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1529, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1625, "mot": "Robert", "types": ["politician", "politician"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1724, "mot": "Reichstag", "types": ["building"], "type": []}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1901, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1967, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2053, "mot": "Angela Merkel", "types": ["politician", "president", "chemist"], "type": ["president"]}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2083, "mot": "Christian Wulff", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["president"]}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2197, "mot": "Reichstag", "types": ["building"], "type": []}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2207, "mot": "Benedict", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2371, "mot": "Europe", "types": ["union"], "type": []}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2691, "mot": "Joseph Ratzinger", "types": ["politician", "philosopher", "priest", "theologian"], "type": ["priest"]}, {"start": 2766, "end": 2772, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 2884, "end": 2899, "mot": "Catholic Church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 2989, "end": 3003, "mot": "mending fences", "types": ["television"], "type": []}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3047, "mot": "Der Spiegel", "types": ["magazine"], "type": []}, {"start": 3100, "end": 3106, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3265, "end": 3279, "mot": "Stern magazine", "types": ["magazine"], "type": []}, {"start": 3437, "end": 3446, "mot": "Reichstag", "types": ["building"], "type": []}, {"start": 3696, "end": 3702, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3710, "end": 3721, "mot": "Augustinian", "types": ["poet", "bishop", "theologian"], "type": ["bishop"]}, {"start": 3888, "end": 3896, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"politician": 11, "philosopher": 7, "priest": 7, "theologian": 8, "airfield": 2, "unit": 6, "building": 4, "house": 1, "president": 2, "chemist": 1, "union": 1, "television": 1, "magazine": 2, "poet": 1, "bishop": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/22/world/europe/germany-pope-visit/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110922101755-pope-germany-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-22T10:05:13Z"}, {"id": "b48021c5-9369-5528-a6b6-442592f406c6", "title": "Inter Milan coach Gasperini sacked after poor start to season", "content": "Inter Milan coach Gasperini sacked after poor start to seasonBy Updated 1631 GMT (0031 HKT) September 21, 2011 JUST WATCHEDInter Milan manager sackedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInter Milan manager sacked 02:52Story highlightsGian Piero Gasperini's reign at Inter ends after just three monthsThe 53-year-old lost two of his first three Serie A matches in charge of InterFormer Genoa coach also tasted defeat in the Italian Super Cup and Champions LeagueGian Piero Gasperini has paid the price for Inter Milan's poor start to the season, being sacked as coach following the 2010 European champions' 3-1 defeat by newly-promoted Novara on Tuesday.The 53-year-old took charge in June, but under his guidance the 18-time Italian Serie A titleholders earned just one point from their opening three league matches to languish in 17th position in the table -- one place outside of the relegation zone.Inter also lost to arch-rivals AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup in August and to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor in their opening European Champions League match. \"F.C.

0-0 draw against Racing SantanderBarcelona came from behind to draw 2-2 with ValenciaIn Serie A, AC Milan also drawSpanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid were both held in La Liga as they battled to unconvincing draws.Real Madrid failed to score for a second consecutive game as they were held 0-0 by Racing Santander.  Coach Jose Mourinho could do little to inject some life into his team as they struggled to break down a spirited Racing defense. In fact it was Racing who could have taken the lead after Oscar Serrano's superb strike was only kept out by a stunning finger-tip save by goalkeeper Iker Casillas.The draw followed Real's 1-0 defeat to Levante and leaves them seventh in the league.\"This was a different match to that against Levante as here it felt as though there was only one side looking to win the game,\" Mourinho told AFP.\"It is a worrying situation as we have now lost five points from two games away from home. It would be wrong to say one player hasn't scored or another one has failed but as a team we weren't at our best although we tried.\"Meanwhile Barcelona were lucky to grab a 2-2 draw with Valencia, La Liga's early, surprise pace-setters.In a chaotic 11 first half minutes Eric Abidal gifted Valencia the lead when he deflected a low cross from the left into his own net. Pedro soon equalized for Barcelona but a few moments later Pablo Hernandez tapped in to restore Valencia's well-deserved advantage.But the match turned on what may well be the miss of the season when Roberto Soldado, totally unmarked and in the middle of an empty net, somehow slid in and diverted the ball past the left hand post.In the second half Barcelona probed in their typically patient fashion before Cesc Fabregas scored his fourth goal of the season. The match finished 2-2.Elsewhere Atletico Madrid won 4-0  win against Sporting Gijon. Big money summer signing Falcao scored twice, taking his tally to five goals in two games. Qatar-owned Malaga beat Athletic Bilbao 1-0 whilst Levante followed their impressive victory over Real Madrid with all three points against Rayo Vallecano, beating them 2-1.In Italy AC Milan needed a 63rd minute goal from teenage substitute Stephan el Shaarawy to earn a 1-1 draw against Udinese. The result means that both Milan clubs have yet to record a win this season. Tuesday night saw Inter Milan lose 3-1 to newly-promoted Novara and coach Gian  Piero Gasperini lose his job.But AC Milan coach Massimilano Allegri insisted that he was happy with his team's performance. \"We played well right up until the end and only risked conceding on the  counter,\" he told AFP.\"It's normal that it's not nice looking at the table but the important thing is how you play. I'm happy because the lads played well and took risks by trying to score.\"Genoa currently lead Serie A on goals scored after beating Catania 3-0.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 22, "end":

match was \"historic\"The football world hadn't seen anything quite like it before.On Tuesday night the Turkish giants of Fenerbahce took on Manisaspor in Istanbul in what should have been an empty stadium.A pitch invasion by Fenerbahce's notoriously boisterous fans during a friendly in July had forced the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) to ban the male supporters from attending two games as punishment.Instead as many as 43,000 women and children took advantage of free tickets to fill the stands with songs, banners and passion every bit as intense as their male compatriots. \"This atmosphere was one of the kind and historic in the sense of Turkish football as well as international football,\" Fenerbahce's vice-president Ali Koc told CNN's Pedro Pinto.

Several of Turkey's highest profile football figures have been arrested during the investigations which lead to the TFF withdrawing Fenerbahce from this year's UEFA Champions League group stage draw.Tuesday night's match was going to be another night of shame for Turkish football, until the TFF allowed children under 12 and an accompanying adult to attend 24 hours before kick off.By the next morning thousands of women in Fenerbahce shirts lined up for tickets and images were beamed across the globe of what was surely the highest female attendance at a men's match in world football. It was a good news story for Fenerbahce just when Turkish football needed it.\"Tuesday night we had 43,000 fans in the stadium,\" Koc told CNN.\"As you know the club is going through some troubled times with allegations of match fixing...The fans have gone beyond the call of duty to embrace the club and fight for the rights of the club.\"According to Koc Fenerbahce has long pursued a more family-friendly approach and regularly attract up to 8,000 women, around 20 per cent of the crowd. \"Lot of songs, a lot of chanting and solidarity,\" Koc replied when asked how the atmosphere differed to a typical match day.\"A man has less patience waiting in line for tickets. Coming to the stadium of course men are lot more loud and more synchronized but the women were a lot more passionate and a lot more encouraging.\"But the crowd was not rewarded with the victory that their efforts demanded. The match ended 1-1 but for Koc the effects will last long after the final whistle.\"I think it's important for Turkey because we [were] a candidate to host the World Cup, Olympics, European Championships and these committees are all sensitive to the abilities of the organizing host country to fill the stadiums [and] in this direction it was a big positive.\"\"We're disappointed we couldn't send the ladies home with a victory.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 139, "end": 146, "mot": "Turkish", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 152, "end": 162, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 227, "end": 237, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 243, "end": 253, "mot": "Manisaspor", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 365, "end": 377, "mot": "match fixing", "types": ["game"], "type": []}, {"start": 406, "end": 409, "mot": "Ali", "types": ["boxer"], "type": []}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 544, "end": 551, "mot": "Turkish", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 562, "end": 572, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 581, "end": 591, "mot": "Manisaspor", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 666, "end": 676, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 748, "end": 775, "mot": "Turkish Football Federation", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1152, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "mot": "Ali", "types": ["boxer"], "type": []}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1186, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1341, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1510, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1534, "mot": "Turkish", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1616, "mot": "match fixing", "types": ["game"], "type": []}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1667, "mot": "Turkey", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1792, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2085, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2278, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2379, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2471, "mot": "match fixing", "types": ["game"], "type": []}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2602, "mot": "Fenerbahce", "types": ["club"], "type": []}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3243, "mot": "Turkey", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 3565, "end": 3573, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"team": 5, "club": 13, "association": 3, "game": 3, "boxer": 2, "company": 4}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/21/sport/football/fenerbahce-all-female-crowd/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110921063250-fenerbahce-women-welcome-hell-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-21T21:30:57Z"}, {"id": "8bffffac-343e-5661-bd86-c4f041d156f0", "title": "Italian scientists on trial over L'Aquila earthquake", "content": "Italian scientists on trial over L'Aquila earthquakeFrom Livia BorgheseUpdated 2052 GMT (0452 HKT) September 20, 2011 Defendant Bernardo De Bernardinis, left, is seen with his lawyer at the start of the trial in L'Aquila, Italy, on Tuesday.Story highlightsMore than 300 people died in the April 2009 earthquake in L'AquilaScientists were asked to assess the risk after increased seismic activityThey did not predict the major earthquake that hit the centuries-old cityProsecutors say they gave a generic and ineffective assessment of the riskSeven people went on trial for manslaughter Tuesday in Italy, accused of failing to predict an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in L'Aquila in April 2009.The seven -- six scientists from the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology and a member of the Civil Protection Agency -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a \"rough, generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk.\"The seven, members of a so-called \"major risks\" panel, published \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population,\" prosecutors said. The first hearing Tuesday morning in L'Aquila's tribunal was devoted to technical matters and claims by injured parties. The city of L'Aquila has requested 50 million euros ($68 million) in compensation. Only one defendant was in court, the vice president of the panel, Bernardo De Bernardinis. \"I thought it was important to be here, not only because this is my turf but also to underline the professionalism ... of the other public officers,\" De Bernardinis told reporters. The trial has attracted the attention of the scientific world. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) wrote to Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano in June last year to express \"concern\" over the indictment of its Italian colleagues.\"The charges against these scientists are both unfair and naive,\" the letter said. The basis of the indictments appears to be that the scientists failed to alert the population of L'Aquila of an impending earthquake. However, the letter continues, \"there is no way they could have done that credibly.\"Lawyer Marcello Melandri is defending Enzo Boschi, who was president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology at the time of the quake. Melandri denies that it's a trial against science, saying: \"Professor Boschi simply said that the earthquake is unpredictable, that it could or it could not happen.\" The Civil Protection Agency had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in L'Aquila on March 31, 2009, amid concern among the city's residents over ongoing seismic activity. After that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press.In particular De Bernardinis said in an interview with a local TV station that the scientific community was \"reassuring\" him, and that the numerous tremors were in some ways a good thing, as they released seismic energy.The interview concluded with a joke. \"Meanwhile, let's go and have a glass of wine,\" the journalist said. \"Absolutely!\" De Bernardinis replied.Six days later, the magnitude-6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas, causing wide destruction and loss of life.Eugenio Carlomagno is among the citizens of L'Aquila to feel let down by the panel. \"There are big responsibilities that this trial has to establish. No one alerted us, there were no evacuation plans that could have saved lives,\" he told CNN. \"It's not a matter of drinking a glass of wine, it's a matter of respecting rules.\"The next  trial session was scheduled for October 1.

Founded by Sladek and a few friends in 1991, EWS is a citizen-owned co-operative that powers 120,000 homes across Germany, using only sustainable energy supplies.Today, following the nuclear explosion in Fukushima and Germany's subsequent commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power over the next decade, EWS is enjoying rocketing demand, and expects to provide for a million homes by 2015. Not bad for a self-professed housewife, who wrest control of her local electricity grid from the nationwide energy provider.Sladek's story starts in 1986, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. Although her home in Schonau was over 2,000 kilometers away from the nuclear plant explosion, traces of radiation had still managed to infect the local wildlife. \"At first we thought: What can the children eat? Can they play outdoors,\" she recalls. \"And we still have this now, when you go into the forest, the mushrooms are still polluted; the wild boar is still polluted ... 25 years after Chernobyl, that is still here.\" Sladek, a mother of five, established \"Parents for a Nuclear Free Future\" -- a regional organization aimed at promoting alternatives to nuclear energy. At the time, Sladek believed that KWR, the power company responsible for providing her town with its electricity, could be persuaded to invest in sustainable supplies and even help its people reduce their reliance on the grid.She was wrong.\"They told us: 'You want to save energy? We sell energy. That's our job. We'll not help you.' We learned that neither the government nor the energy supplier would do anything.\" It was exactly this response that spurred Sladek and others living in Schonau into what they did next.\"We never thought about overtaking a grid and doing what we're now doing,\" says Sladek. \"Their attitude was the reason why we wanted to.\" And so, when KWR's licence to operate the power grid came up for renewal in 1991, Sladek and her group created their own power-company and launched a local petition to convince the town council and the population to let them manage it cooperatively. After many years and battles, in 1997, EWS had raised enough money -- about \u20ac2 million -- to buy the contract to supply Schonau with non-nuclear electricity.  Collectively owned by 1,000 citizens, the company gets all its energy from green sources, mainly hydropower operations, but also including solar panels and wind turbines. Some homes even have small co-generation systems that produce domestic heat as well as electricity that can be sold back to the grid. So do EWS customers pay a premium to keep a clean and green conscience? Nope. In fact, according to Sladek, they pay less. \"We're offering (electricity) even cheaper than companies which supply their customers with nuclear power or with coal power,\" she says.  \"That is because we don't want to gain as much money as the others do. Of course, we have to gain money as well because we have people who work for us ...

the limits of what can be achieved with the existing facility have been achieved.\"The site will also contain a 7,000-capacity stadium for youth team matches, a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the Etihad Stadium to the area -- which will be known as the Etihad Campus.\"The development and recruitment of youth talent is at the heart of our long term strategy of building a sustainable football club for the future,\" City's chief football operations office Brian Marwood said.\"The opportunity to build a world class facility supported by a well researched youth development plan would be a significant step in the realization of that strategy.\"Gavin Hamilton, editor of World Soccer magazine, told CNN that despite the City's financial investment in their youth set-up, only time will tell whether it will change their current strategy of signing big-name stars such as Argentina striker Sergio Aguero and Spain midfielder David Silva.\"I'm always slightly suspicious when big clubs start investing in youth policies,\" said Hamilton. \"Chelsea did it a few years ago and very few young players have come through the youth system there.\"Hamilton also cast doubt on City's ability to match the set-up of European champions Barcelona, who have brought a number of first-team regulars through their famous La Masia academy.\"I'm always suspicious as well when clubs say they're going to copy Barcelona, because they are the great team of the moment and it's very fashionable to copy what they're doing.\"But what Barcelona have been doing goes back decades, you can't just buy it overnight. Even if you're talking about a long-term development plan it's going to take decades.\"Hamilton also said that the successful development of young players is not necessarily achieved through financial investment, but through adopting the correct attitude to nurturing emerging talent -- citing Dutch champions Ajax as a perfect example of the right approach.\"The clubs that are successful with youth policies are the clubs that don't necessarily spend a lot of money, but believe in youngsters and believe in putting youngsters into the first team at an early age.\"So a club like Ajax, which is famed for its youth academy, wouldn't spend a huge amount more than other clubs.

The arrest was made in Cala Ratjada, on the northeast side of Mallorca, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the island's capital, Palma de Mallorca. Authorities have been investigating the suspect since last year. He is wanted for allegedly recruiting and indoctrinating others for the terrorist group and for distributing public messages aimed at provoking terrorist attacks, the statement said.Spain's Balearic archipelago in the Mediterranean is a popular tourist resort for Spaniards and others from Europe, with large contingents of Britons and Germans visiting or residing there.An Interior Ministry spokeswoman, speaking under customary anonymity, said the 24-year-old suspect has been taken to Madrid for arraignment before the National Court, which handles terrorism cases. Under Spanish law, he can be held for up to 72 hours before arraignment. The suspect had 1,120 radical videos on the Internet, mostly produced by him, and he was the administrator of various internet channels, the Interior Ministry said. He used the internet for the radical indoctrination of other individuals, the statement said.Authorities seized various portable computers, external hard drives and USB memory sticks, according to the ministry. Since the Madrid train bombings of 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others, Spanish police have arrested more than 400 suspected al Qaeda militants or collaborators. Most have been of North African or Middle Eastern origin, with a few from Latin America, the spokeswoman said.

It would leave us completely exposed at the back, but we would take the risk trying to get the draw.\"Chelsea had numerous attempts at goal during an open match, with Brazil midfielder Ramires also guilty of spurning a good opportunity while the score was only 1-0.\"We are pretty happy with how the team reacted to such a negative impact at half time, when the team was playing well. We cannot say the team was playing awful and that 3-0 at half time was a fair result.\"Villas-Boas also bemoaned the officiating in the match, claiming English champions United scored their opening two goals from offside positions.\"It didn't fall our way in every kind of the word, not only in terms of goalscoring opportunities but in terms of refereeing decisions or the linesman's decisions ...They influenced the game, it's 2-0 instead of 0-0.\"The defeat was Chelsea's first under Villas-Boas and the four-time English title winners have collected 10 points from their first five matches.Their next Premier League fixtures will see them entertain newly-promoted Swansea City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

Talking to CNN's Pedro Pinto, the Ghanaian also claimed there was no bad blood between him and Sunderland coach Steve Bruce after his last minute move to the Middle East.\"I'm still a player of Sunderland. I didn't have any confrontation with anyone. We are still alright. I was cool with the manager,\" he told CNN. \"People say I moved because of money....You need to be happy -- although I'm not saying I wasn't happy at Sunderland or I wasn't happy in the [English] Premier League. \"I had to decide with my family and everything and they were alright with my decision so I had to just move...it helped myself and Sunderland as well.\"Gyan's move from Sunderland in the English Premier League to Al Ain, a club that hails from a city built around an oasis deep in the desert, was arguably the most controversial of the recent transfer window.The Ghanaian scored ten goals in his 34 appearances for Sunderland and appeared to have adjusted well to the fast-paced English game.But instead of building on his promising start Gyan opted to move to the Middle East instead.\"In life you have to experience things. I think moving here I don't regret at all because Al Ain is a great club and I'm ready to give everything,\" he explained.\"It's another step in my life. Although I'm still a player of Sunderland.

Maradona will be in charge of Dubai club Al Wasl, France international David Trezeguet has joined Abu Dhabi club Bani Yas whilst former Inter Milan midfielder Luis Jimenez will be playing at Al Ahli. Last year's champions, Al Jazira of Abu Dhabi, are bankrolled by Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan Whilst there are fabulous riches to be found in the UAE Pro League, it isn't without its controversies. Attendances have been dire since the league went professional in 2008. The situation got so bad that the UAE FA disbanded the league and took it under their control last June.Yet for Gyan the draw of Asian Champions League football was enough to convince him that the standard this season will be high.\"The English Premiership is one of the best in the world. I do respect that. I enjoyed myself really last season,\" he said. \"Moving to the Asian league is another step in my life. Who knows maybe I can bring some exposure in the Asian league.

newspaper to reveal confidential sources who provided information on the phone-hacking scandal.After taking legal advice, the Metropolitan Police Service said it decided \"not to pursue, at this time, the application for production orders\" against the paper and one of its reporters. A hearing had been scheduled for Friday.\"This investigation ... has always been about establishing whether a police officer has leaked information, and gathering any evidence that proves or disproves that. Despite recent media reports there was no intention to target journalists or disregard journalists' obligations to protect their sources,\" police said in a statement.News International to settle in hacking scandalThe Guardian has taken a lead in reporting on the scandal around alleged phone hacking at the News of the World newspaper, which may have affected scores of celebrities, politicians and victims of crime.In a story posted on its website Tuesday, the newspaper cheered the decision to withdraw the \"ill-judged order.\"\"We would have fought this assault on public interest journalism all the way. We're happy that good sense has prevailed,\" the paper quoted its editor, Alan Rusbridger, as saying.News of the World was shuttered in July amid public outrage that followed the Guardian's July 4 accusation that the voice mail of missing teenager Milly Dowler, later found murdered, was hacked by the paper's reporters.Far-reaching tentacles of the hacking scandalMore than a dozen people have been arrested and bailed so far in the course of the Metropolitan Police investigation into the allegations, codenamed Operation Weeting. A second inquiry is looking at claims that police were bribed.The phone-hacking scandal has forced two top police officers to resign and put Prime Minister David Cameron under pressure for hiring another former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, to be his spokesman.

Two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology, vanish with barely a trace left behind. One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month --  have failed to find \"HMS Erebus\" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named \"HMS Terror\" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic.In 1845 British Royal Navy captain Sir John Franklin set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the Northwest Passage. Franklin's expedition wasn't the first to the region, but it is the most infamous.\"Why did this fail when all the others didn't,\" asks author William Battersby. \"There was something jinxed about the expedition.\" Battersby is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of Franklin's last voyage. \"We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don't and we still don't know why.\"The environment of the Northwest Passage is unforgiving. The landscape is vast and deserted, comparable only to Jupiter's moons. The winters are unrelenting and bleak. Franklin's men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region. Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew. \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" says Bob Headland from the Scott Polar Research Institute, who regularly visits the region. '\"And the ice gods are a fickle lot.\"The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them. Ryan Harris from Parks Canada led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks. Last month, his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor, searching waters up to 50 meters deep. \"It's an incredible story. It's got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature,\" says Harris.Since 1997 Parks Canada has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror.\" The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn't been found yet.\"Once Franklin received his orders that sealed his fate,\" Harris explains. \"In directing them south-west into ultimately the Victoria Strait it took them to the ice choke point. Once they fell into the clutch of that area, their fate was sealed. There's not much wildlife there and it is isolated.\"The last known account of the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" came in 1848. A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive. Franklin was one of the first casualties of his own expedition. That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food. However the harsh environment supported little, and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed, the chance of survival was low. It's been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last-ditch efforts to survive. \"There were far too many men to live off the environment. What man plans and what nature allows are two different things,\" says Headland.Archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral Inuit history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship.But questions remain over exactly what happened to them. In 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered. It is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but Battersby believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors. His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water. It's hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers.'\"There's a charm to the story,\" acknowledges Harris. \"By solving a mystery it takes the allure away.\" But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the \"Erebus\" and the \"Terror\" are found. Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts. \"I hope we're the last,\" says Harris.But after 160 years it's possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever. \"These are the last of the ghost ships,\" says Battersby. \"It is the world's biggest ghost story.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start":

McGuinness was selected by Sinn Fein Sunday to be their candidate for president of the Republic of Ireland.Story highlightsMartin McGuinness is running for president of IrelandHe admits being an IRA leader in the past but is now a \"peacemaker\"Ireland chooses a new president October 27Northern Irish citizens can run for Irish president Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein candidate for president of Ireland, refused Monday to answer questions about his past as a local commander of the Provisional IRA.McGuinness said he \"would not be interrogated\" by an interviewer on local radio and refused to answer questions about specific IRA killings.The former IRA leader was selected by his party Sunday to be their candidate for president of the Republic of Ireland and is stepping down as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister to run.Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott said Monday that McGuinness should \"come clean\" over his IRA past and apologize to victims.Elliott, whose pro-British party is on the opposite side of the Northern Ireland divide from McGuinness' Sinn Fein, said it would be \"extremely useful if he were to sit down and talk of his overall involvement in the IRA and accept that their campaign was wrong.\"That would help alleviate the hurt of the victims, hurt caused by Martin McGuinness and the IRA,\" Elliott said.But not all victims object to McGuinness' candidacy.Alan McBride, whose wife was killed in a bomb attack on the mainly Protestant Shankill Road in Belfast in 1993, said he has \"no real reservations\" about McGuinness running.\"We have been in a (peace) process for many years and I recognise the role Martin McGuinness has played in that in terms of getting us to where we are,\" he said, adding that he recognized other victims \"would have very mixed views\" on McGuinness.About 3,500 people were killed in violence between pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans in the three decades up to the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998.Accepting his party's nomination Sunday, McGuinness said republicans have an obligation to \"heal the wounds of their actions.\"In recent years, he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process.He referred to a recent upsurge in violence in the province in his speech Sunday.\"I know there will be a very strong temptation for people to drag us back to the past. God knows there are enough of them trying to do so, in a violent sense, at the moment,\" he said.He described himself as a man of peace who can work across sectarian lines.\"People see me very much as a peacemaker, but, more importantly, they see me as a peacemaker who can be trusted,\" he said. \"I have every confidence that the peace process will be strengthened by my participation in the presidential election.\"\"I am proud to have served in government alongside unionists,\" he said, referring to those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom rather than uniting with the republic to the south. \"I can work with anyone. Times have changed in the North.\"Sinn Fein won 14 seats in the Irish parliament, the Dail Eireann, in elections this year.Ireland's president is a largely ceremonial role, with national elections held every seven years.There is no constitutional bar on a citizen of Northern Ireland -- that is, a British citizen -- running for president of the Republic of Ireland.The current Irish President, Mary McAleese, is from Northern Ireland. McAleese was elected in 1997 and is now at the end of her second term.But people living in Northern Ireland cannot vote in Irish presidential elections, so McGuinness will not be able to vote for himself.Sinn Fein -- which believes Northern Ireland should become part of the republic -- has launched a campaign for voting rights to be extended to include Northern Ireland.Elections are due to be held October 27.An opinion poll published Sunday showed Labour's Michael D. Higgins leading the race, ahead of Sen. David Norris, who announced Friday he was back in after withdrawing in August.But the Sunday Independent/Millward Brown Lansdowne poll was completed before Norris said he was rejoining the race and before Sinn Fein put McGuinness' name forward.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 53, "end": 56, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 169, "end": 178, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 337, "end": 340, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 502, "end": 511, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 769, "end": 772, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1012, "mot": "Tom Elliott", "types": ["leader", "member"], "type": ["leader"]}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1218, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1462, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1621, "mot": "Shankill Road", "types": ["street"], "type": []}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2314, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2522, "mot": "drag", "types": ["actor", "artist"], "type": ["artist"]}, {"start": 2745, "end": 2755, "mot": "peacemaker", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 2797, "end": 2807, "mot": "peacemaker", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 3221, "end": 3230, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 3582, "end": 3595, "mot": "Mary McAleese", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 4075, "end": 4081, "mot": "Labour", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 4135, "end": 4147, "mot": "David Norris", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 4221, "end": 4239, "mot": "Sunday Independent", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 4240, "end": 4254, "mot": "Millward Brown", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 4255, "end": 4264, "mot": "Lansdowne", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 4340, "end": 4349, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 4390, "end": 4398, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"party": 7, "force": 8, "leader": 3, "member": 1, "street": 1, "actor": 1, "artist": 1, "politician": 2, "president": 1, "newspaper": 1, "company": 2, "team": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/19/world/europe/ireland-president/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110919041543-martin-mcguinness-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-19T13:10:29Z"}, {"id": "921e4b18-ea9b-5709-a801-7925f5c70e4c", "title": "'Dream come true' for youngest winner Thompson", "content": "'Dream come true' for youngest winner ThompsonBy Updated 0900 GMT (1700 HKT) September 20, 2011 Lexi Thompson became the youngest-ever winner of the junior PGA Championship in 2007.Story highlightsLexi Thompson becomes the youngest-ever winner on the LPGA TourThe 16-year-old clinched a five-shot victory at the Navistar ClassicThompson participated at the women's U.S. Open aged 12Lexi Thompson struggled to describe her delight after she won the Navistar LPGA Classic on Sunday to become the female golf tour's youngest-ever winner.Thompson's five-shot triumph at the Robert Trent Jones Trail's Capitol Hill Senator Course -- aged 16 year, seven months and eight days -- beat the record previously held by her fellow American Marlene Hagge.\"It feels amazing,\" Thompson told the Tour's official website. \"I can't even describe it.

eighth of a dominant season with his teammate Dani Pedrosa of Spain in second place.Reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo finished third at the Motorland circuit on his Yamaha and now trails Stoner by

recovering from an indifferent start .\"I wanted to get to the front as soon as possible as the bike has been working perfect all weekend and it was our race to lose, so I tried to get in front and

Revelations surfaced in July that journalists working for the News of the World at the time of her disappearance had eavesdropped on Milly's phone, deleting some of her messages to make room for more. The deletion of messages gave the family hope she was still alive when she was already dead.Public and political outrage in Britain was immediate and intense, and less than a week after the reports surfaced, News International chief executive James Murdoch ordered the closing of News of the World, a best-selling Sunday paper. James Murdoch is the son of Rupert Murdoch.Previously, News of the World apologized for hacking into the voice mails of celebrities and politicians, paying compensation to actress Sienna Miller and offering money to others. An out-of-court settlement of 700,000 pounds (U.S. $1.2 million) was paid to English soccer executive Gordon Taylor for \"illegal voice mail interception.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 18, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 55, "end": 58, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 142, "end": 147, "mot": "Gemma", "types": ["singer", "director"], "type": ["director"]}, {"start": 206, "end": 218, "mot": "Milly Dowler", "types": ["person"], "type": []}, {"start": 540, "end": 558, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 856, "end": 859, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 895, "end": 909, "mot": "Rupert Murdoch", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 943, "end": 961, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1119, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1276, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1415, "mot": "Milly Dowler", "types": ["person"], "type": []}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1894, "mot": "News International", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1924, "mot": "James Murdoch", "types": ["leader", "executive"], "type": ["executive"]}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2009, "mot": "James Murdoch", "types": ["leader", "executive"], "type": ["executive"]}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2189, "mot": "Sienna Miller", "types": ["actress", "model"], "type": ["actress"]}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2335, "mot": "Gordon Taylor", "types": ["winger"], "type": []}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2393, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 9, "singer": 1, "director": 1, "person": 2, "leader": 3, "executive": 2, "actress": 1, "model": 1, "winger": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/19/world/europe/uk-phone-hacking-settlement/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110919084400-dowler-family-hacking-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-19T20:09:55Z"}, {"id": "d0b934bc-7e77-5116-b42d-3ae29d4f4ca7", "title": "Football: Rangers win Old Firm Derby ", "content": "Football: Rangers win Old Firm Derby By Updated 1541 GMT (2341 HKT) September 18, 2011 Two-goal Steven Naismith celebrates as Rangers beat Celtic 4-2 in the Old Firm Derby  Story highlightsRangers score three second half goals to beat Celtic in Glasgow's Old Firm DerbySteven Naismith on target in each half for Rangers who go four points clear at top in Scotland Celtic have Charlie Mulgrew sent off in the second half for second bookable foulOld Firm Derby is one of the most hotly-contested in world footballRangers scored three second-half goals to beat Celtic 4-2 in Glasgow's Old Firm Derby Sunday and go four points clear in the Scottish Premier League.In-form Steven Naismith fired Rangers ahead with a thumping strike after 22nd minutes but Celtic were quick to level through Gary Hooper's well-worked goal 12 minutes later.Celtic took the lead just before halftime as Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor allowed a weak shot from Moroccan Badr El Kaddouri to elude his grasp and trickle into the net.But Nikica Jelavic headed Rangers level seven minutes after the interval and they were ahead when Kyle Lafferty converted after 67 minutes.

Potro Del Potro's win gives Argentina winning 3-1 lead in BelgradeRafael Nadal secures Spain's passage to the final as he beats Jo-Wilfried TsongaDavis Cup holders Serbia exited this year's competition as their world number one Novak Djokovic was forced to retire from his crucial rubber against Juan Martin Del Potro with a back injury.Djokovic, who sat out the opening round of singles matches, was trailing a set and 3-0 when he called it a day in front of a partisan home crowd in the Belgrade Arena.Del Potro's victory gave Argentina an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the tie, ending home hopes after Nenad Zimonjic and Viktor Troicki had pulled Serbia back into contention with their doubles victory Saturday.They will play Spain in the final after Rafael Nadal gave them a winning 3-1 lead over France with a crushing straight sets win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on the clay in Cordoba.France, like Serbia, had won the doubles rubber to trail 2-1, but Nadal, beaten by Djokovic in the U.S. Open final last week, showed no signs of fatigue with a 6-0 6-2 6-4 victory.It was the second success of the weekend for Nadal, who beat Richard Gasquet in the opening singles matches, backed up by David Ferrer's win over Gilles Simon.Tsonga, who beat Nadal at Queen's Club earlier this year, was no match for the world number two on his favorite surface and despite a brief rally in the third set was beaten in a little over two hours.Gasquet was to play Fernando Verdasco in the final dead rubber. The victory avenged Spain's 5-0 whitewash by France in last year's  quarterfinals.France went on to reach the final where they were beaten by a resurgent Serbia in the final, with Djokovic leading the way as he embarked on his incredible unbeaten run and victory in three of this year's four grand slams.But Sunday saw one of his few setbacks in 2011, visibly struggling after losing a tight first set tiebreak 7-5. 2009 U.S Open champion Del Potro showed no mercy and quickly broke at the start of the second to take control.Djokovic, who had needed treatment for his back while beating Nadal at Flushing Meadows, admitted after his defeat that he had taken a risk in attempting to lift his country back into the tie.\"I was not even 60 percent ready, but we have accepted that risk although we knew that my injury could worsen,\" he told the official Davis Cup website.\"I am not angry, just sad and disappointed, as I really believed I could  endure the match and win it, but against a player who pulled in 80 percent of his first serve, that was impossible,\" Djokovic added.He will now have further tests to examine the extent of his injury ahead of lucrative end of year tournaments which culminate in the ATP Tour Finals in London.Meanwhile,  Argentina will travel to Spain for December's final in a repeat of the 2008 title match which the Spanish won in Mar del Plata.

The misses still continued with Rooney setting up substitute Dimitar Berbatov for another cast-iron opportunity but the Bulgarian's weak effort was cleared off the line by Ashley Cole.It has been the best start to a season for United since 1985 and they started with a flourish as Chris Smalling headed home Ashley Young's free kick.Torres screwed a right foot shot wide to spurn an immediate chance to draw Chelsea level before Portugal star Nani put the home side 2-0 ahead with a rasping strike which left Petr Cech with no chance.Chelsea looked dangerous going forward, but defensive sloppiness after a charge forward by United defender Phil Jones left Rooney with the simplest of tap-ins to make it 3-0 just before halftime.United's win was marred by an injury to striker Javier Hernandez, caught by a challenge from Cole as he tried to follow up on a Rooney shot that hit the post in the second half.Manager Alex Ferguson was furious with the challenge which may sideline the Mexican for several weeks. \"For me it's a shocking tackle. The referee has booked him (Cole) and if  he's booked him I don't know why it wasn't a penalty, \" he told Sky Sports. But the victory for Ferguson's men saw them pull two points clear of local rivals Manchester City, who were held 2-2 at Fulham earlier Sunday after leading 2-0.Sergio Aguero continued his remarkable introduction to the EPL with a double strike at Craven Cottage, but City relaxed and Bobby Zamora and Danny Murphy salvaged a point for the home side.Sunday's other high-profile clash saw Tottenham Hotspur continue their recovery from a poor start to the season with a 4-0 win over Liverpool at White Hart Lane.Luka Modric put Tottenham ahead with a superb strike and Liverpool were further handicapped by having Charlie Adam and Martin Skrtel sent off in either half.Tottenham capitalized against nine men as Jermain Defoe and the excellent Emmanuel Adebayor with a late double rubbed salt into the wound.The other match Sunday saw Sunderland move off the bottom with a 4-0 thumping of Stoke City.

from Continental Europe before retaining the Vivendi Seve Trophy at St- Nom-La-Breteche in France Sunday.Victory looked a formality as the Continentals trailed by five points overnight heading into the final 10 singles matches, but Jean Van De Velde's side won the first five singles contests to square the match.It set up a dramatic finale with Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts taking a half off  England's David Horsey, but rookie Scott Jamieson scored a crucial win for Paul McGinley's men as he beat  Pablo Larrazabal.The heavyweight clash between Ian Poulter and young Italian star Matteo Manassero proved even more vital and it was the Englishman who snatched victory on the final green as he again showed his match play abilities with a three birdie run on the back nine.Mark Foster went one up against Raphael Jacquelin on the 17th to guarantee the 14 1/2 points for victory, going on to wrap up the point as the eventual margin was 15 1/2 to 12 1/2 with Ross Fisher and Peter Hanson all square in the last match out on course.\"Lucky I had the team well balanced out, and had not just experience but guys in form balanced throughout the team, so they came through in the end,\" McGinley told the official European Tour website.But his team had suffered a massive scare as Thomas Bjorn led from the front for the Continentals by beating Lee Westwood in the top match 2 and 1.Bjorn's compatriot  Anders Hansen beat Simon Dyson and Francesco Molinari saw off Jamie Donaldson.Alex Noren then beat Robert Rock 4 and 3 and British Open Champion Darren Clarke lost 4 and 2 to former Ryder Cup partner Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez to leave the contest tied at 11 1/2-11 1/2.But up stepped Jamieson and former WGC World Match Play champion Poulter to score their wins.Van De Velde said: \"It was extremely close, even going down the stretch.\"All credit to Poulter for making three birdies in five holes.

points with 10 singles matches to play and McGinley admitted his team had played superbly to open up a big lead.\"Our concentration levels were really good, and we were really up for it. We're really motivated and really concentrated and we are really focused. We got the job done,\" he told the official European Tour website. \"I think my pairings fortunately worked well again, and we were fresh. We were a very fresh team and hopefully that's going to be the case tomorrow, too.\" Great Britain & Ireland dominated both sessions with Simon Dyson and Jamie Donaldson paving the way in the morning fourballs  with a 2 and 1 win over Nicolas Colsaerts and Matteo Manassero.Ian Poulter was joined by Ryder Cup and World Cup playing partner Ross Fisher in a 2 and 1 win over in-form Thomas Bjorn and Raphael Jacquelin, while World No.2  Lee Westwood and Scott Jamieson were 4 and 3 winners over Spaniards Pablo Larrazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez.The Continentals only half point came when Swedes Peter Hanson and Alex Noren finished all square with David Horsey and British Open champion Darren Clarke.Bjorn, winner of the Johnnie Walker Championship and European Masters in the past month,  paired with Danish compatriot  Anders Hansen to beat Fisher and Mark Foster 3 and 2 in the afternoon foursomes to give Jean Van De Velde's men some hope.Manassero and compatriot Francesco Molinari halved with Robert Rock and Donaldson but Dutch Open champion Dyson chipped in at the 17th to seal a 3 and 1 win for himself and Poulter over Larrazabal and Noren. Westwood and Horsey wrapped up a superb day for their team with a 4 and 3 victory over Jacquelin and Colsaerts.Westwood will be up against Bjorn in the opening singles match Sunday with Van De Velde hoping his men can gain some early momentum.\"If we don't put points on the board straightaway, I'm afraid the competition is going to be over,\" he admitted.GB and Ireland have won the last five stagings of the trophy after Continental Europe claimed the first event in 2000.On the PGA Tour, England's Justin Rose shot a two-under par  69 to take four-shot lead after the third round of the $8 million BMW  Championship.Rose has a three round total of  13-under par 200 to take control at  the penultimate event of the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs.Australian John Senden is in second place on 204, one stroke ahead of his compatriot Geoff Ogilvy and Bill Haas.

Casey Stoner in thirdDani Pedrosa set the fastest time in the opening practice session ahead of Sunday's MotoGP race in Spain, before a power cut short Friday's action.Honda's Pedrosa recorded a lap of one minute 50.281 seconds around the Aragon circuit, but electrical problems prevented riders taking to the track for the day's second session.As a result of the difficulties, Saturday's free practice will now be longer in order to help teams prepare for Sunday's grand prix -- the 14th round of the 2011 season.Jorge Lorenzo, the Yamaha rider currently second in the world championship, was nearly half a second behind Pedrosa, with current standings leader Casey Stoner third fastest on board a Honda.Pedrosa had his start to the season disrupted after a shoulder injury picked up at the

president of IrelandBy Peter Taggart, For CNNUpdated 0830 GMT (1630 HKT) September 18, 2011 Story highlightsMartin McGuinness will run for president of Ireland next month, Sinn Fein saysMcGuinness admitted to being a provisional IRA leader years agoHe has since supported the peace processThe office of president is largely ceremonial, with certain limited powersFormer IRA leader Martin McGuinness is set to stand as a candidate in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election next month, Sinn Fein announced Friday.McGuinness is currently the deputy first minister in Northern Ireland  and a senior member of the political party Sinn Fein.Sinn Fein said Friday that the party's officer board had nominated McGuinness for the office of president. The recommendation has to be ratified by Sinn Fein's ruling council Sunday, but party members say that vote is likely to be a formality. McGuinness admitted several years ago he had been a provisional IRA  leader during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In recent years, he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process.McGuinness is expected to temporarily step down as deputy first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government during the election campaign. If elected, he would resign from his position in Northern Ireland.The Sinn Fein leader has spent this week in the United States with First Minister Peter Robinson on a five-day investment mission.The post of president of Ireland is the country's head of state and is elected by the people every seven years. It is a largely ceremonial office, with certain limited powers. The president is the guardian of the constitution and has the power to refer contentious laws to the supreme court.Mary McAleese has been the president since 1997 and is nearing the end of her second term of office. McAleese hosted a historic visit to Ireland by Britain's Queen Elizabeth the second in May days before U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in the country.Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said Friday that he believes the office of president had been made \"more relevant\" by McAleese and her predecessor, Mary Robinson.\"This is a time of great challenge for all the people of Ireland. We need positive but authentic leadership,\" Adams added. \"It will be a great honor for me to propose Martin McGuinness to contest this election on a broad, republican, citizen-centered platform.\"I believe that this election will give Martin the platform to continue the work which he has led in the North (Northern Ireland) and in the peace process and to put it on a national footing. I believe he can be the people's president.\"Adams continued: \"He will dedicate himself to a genuine national reconciliation and the unity of our people. He will personify hope in the great genius and integrity of all the people of this island, Catholics, Protestants and dissenters.\"Adams appealed for people in Northern Ireland and \"across the diaspora\" to be allowed to vote in the election, to be held October 27.Also Friday, Irish Senator David Norris said he intends to re-enter the race to become head of state.Norris -- previously tipped to be the first openly gay president of Ireland -- withdrew from the contest August 2.He abandoned his bid after it emerged he had made a plea for clemency for a former lover convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in Israel in the 1990s.However, Norris told Irish television Friday night he had changed his mind and is seeking support to relaunch his campaign following a \"consistent outpouring\" of public support.He now has to secure political nominations to get his name on the presidential ballot paper.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 7, "end": 10, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 204, "end": 213, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 261, "end": 264, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 402, "end": 405, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 525, "end": 534, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 824, "end": 833, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1160, "mot": "IRA", "types": ["force"], "type": []}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1451, "mot": "Sinn Fein", "types": ["party"], "type": []}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1534, "mot": "Peter Robinson", "types": ["composer"], "type": []}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2032, "mot": "Queen Elizabeth", "types": ["member"], "type": []}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2055, "mot": "May days", "types": ["battle"], "type": []}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2090, "mot": "Barack Obama", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2145, "mot": "Gerry Adams", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2275, "mot": "Mary Robinson", "types": ["politician", "president"], "type": ["politician"]}, {"start": 3163, "end": 3183, "mot": "Senator David Norris", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3816, "end": 3824, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"force": 5, "party": 4, "composer": 1, "member": 1, "battle": 1, "politician": 4, "president": 2, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/16/world/europe/ireland-president/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-16T20:21:49Z"}, {"id": "f58fd5f4-6ec5-5844-855c-b3136a93ff1a", "title": "European team fight back against Britain and Ireland", "content": "European team fight back against Britain and IrelandBy Updated 1951 GMT (0351 HKT) September 16, 2011 Matteo Manassaro was one of Europe's winners, helping Nicolas Colsaerts to defeat Ross Fisher and  Scott JamiesonStory highlightsThe European team have fought back on the second day of the Vivendi Seve TrophyBritain and Ireland now lead by just one point after Europe won three of the five fourballs The European team, who have only won the tournament only once, now trail 5 1/2 to 4 1/2Great Britain and Ireland hold a narrow one point lead over Continental Europe after the second day of the Videndi Seve Trophy in Paris, after the European team won three of the five fourballs on Friday.Europe -- who began the day trailing four points to one -- have won the event only once, back in 2000, but they began their comeback in the opening match when Swede's  Alex Noren and Peter Hanson thrashed Ian Poulter and Robert Rock 5&3.Thomas Bjorn and Raphael Jacquelin then fought back from three down to snatch a half from Simon Dyson and Jamie Donaldson, before the European pair of Nicolas Colsaerts and Matteo Manassero defeated Ross Fisher and  Scott Jamieson 2 up.Great Britain and Ireland's only win came when world number two Lee  Westwood and Mark Foster comfortably saw off  Anders Hansen and Francesco Molinari 5&3.But a 3&2 success for Spanish pair Pablo Larrazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez over Darren Clarke and David Horsey in the final match-up ensured just a point separated the teams at the end of the day's play.   \"It was a good reaction after the opening day,\" European skipper Jean Van De Velde told reporters. \"I'm very  happy with what I've seen. \"The intensity was there, the commitment was there.

There is no doubt as to which soccer team Marshall and his clientele give their loyalties. Decorated in the team colors of red, white and blue throughout its interior and situated only a stone's throw from the famous Ibrox Stadium, the bar is overt in its homage to Rangers Football Club.In fact, to call any establishment that has a stained-glass window in honor of Jim Baxter -- a Scotland midfielder who played for the \"Gers\" in the 1960s -- and a six-foot club badge painted on the ceiling a mere drinking hole is a disservice, it is closer to a shrine. Its position around the corner from the Glasgow Orange Order -- a Protestant fraternity who still march once a year to celebrate the victory of King William III over the Catholic King James II in 1690 at the Battle of the Boyne --  may be a mere coincidence, the allegiance of its regulars to Rangers is not.Across town, on the Gallowgate road, Tommy Carberry pulls pints in Bairds Bar, a building daubed in the green hue synonymous with Celtic Football Club.  The pub sits a mile-or-so from Celtic Park -- the 60,000-seater home ground of the 42-time Scottish title winners  -- and is a much-loved stopping point for fans attending the match. JUST WATCHED A new future for the Old Firm?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH A new future for the Old Firm? 05:32This area of the east end is known locally as the \"Barras\" -- slang for the barrow markets -- and is inextricably linked with an influx of Irish immigrants who settled in the area in the 19th century to escape the potato famine.Inside, a myriad of patrons dressed in green and white jerseys pack into the ale house, where Bodhran drums adorn the walls, to sup their stout and sing along to Irish music which jingles from the speakers. Many have traveled across the Irish Sea as part of a fortnightly pilgrimage to see the action in an arena dubbed \"Paradise\" by such faithful followers of football. Celtic wears its Irish and Catholic heritage very much on its sleeve -- or chest to be more exact, as the club's four-leafed clover badge sits on the left breast of its players -- which is maybe not surprising for a team founded by a member of a Catholic religious order in 1888.    The two landlords -- who remarkably, are childhood friends -- represent two of Glasgow's communities in a microcosm, one passionately British and Protestant, the other proud of their Catholic and Irish heritage, a division which mirrors the sectarian lines of Northern Ireland, loyalties forged over centuries of war and strife. Like their fathers before them, Robert and Tommy's cultural background almost dictated which of the city's two giant clubs they would support. Allegiance to Rangers or Celtic carries a cultural significance above a mere love of the beautiful game for many nestled around the banks of the Clyde.     The Old Firm It is one of the ingredients that makes the meeting of these two teams, over 90 minutes of football, so special. Celtic versus Rangers is one of the fiercest rivalries in world football.The coming together of the two communities in the cauldron of a stadium to cheer on their sides, as well as proclaim their identity with songs and banners, creates a unique and febrile atmosphere. On one side of the arena the red, white and blue of the British Union Flag. On the other the green, white and gold of the Irish tricolor flag.The clash -- which normally happens four times every season in the league alone -- even has its own nickname: The Old Firm.It is usually highly charged and often controversial. In the past players celebrating a goal by making the sign of a cross or miming a flute from a Protestant marching band have provoked serious trouble in the stands.On Sunday the \"Old Firm\" play each other again for the first time in the new season. But the 396th edition of the rivalry will be played amid plans by the Scottish government to stamp out what it says is religious bigotry associated with the fixture.It follows what was a tumultuous season in 2010/ 11, where many felt the sectarian nature of the fixture escalated to unacceptable levels. Though both clubs are committed to creating tolerant atmosphere's within their home arenas, the singing of provocative songs has often been present among a minority of fans. \"The Billy Boys\" chant -- which includes the line \"we're up to knees in Feinian [a derogatory term which means Catholic terrorist] blood\" -- and songs glorifying the IRA [Irish Republican Army] are just two examples of anthems that have dogged the match for as long as memories go back. Other common targets include the pope and the British queen.In the early part of 2011, these sentiments -- which are usually only in the background -- came to the fore.Rangers were admonished and received a ban by UEFA -- the governing body of European football -- for sectarian singing in a game against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, while the family of Celtic's Catholic manager Neil Lennon was put under 24-hour police surveillance when live ammunition and a parcel bomb were sent to him in the post.The government decided it was time to act.The proposal Roseanna Cunningham, the lawmaker for Community Safety and Legal Affairs in Scotland, told CNN: \"We've had a problem with sectarianism in Scotland for a long time, and it is most manifest -- though not solely -- in football. What we saw last season was a ratcheting up of the tension to a level we'd not seen before ... and we decided that we needed to tackle this specifically with legislation.\"The draft law that is being assessed before its anticipated introduction in 2012, will create offences from behavior which \"incites religious, racial or other forms of hatred at football grounds\" including \"threats intended to incite religious hatred\" according to an official government statement. Arguably this could include the provocative songs sung by a minority of fans at Old Firm games and the penalties, if found guilty, could be tough.\"The penalties will be anything from a fine to five years in prison. We want to make sure people are aware of how seriously we take this,\" Cunningham added.\"The law [if passed] can't change a culture, we know that ... but we hope, ultimately, it will result in the better behavior of football fans without the necessity of using the law.\"It is a sentiment that has been welcomed by the local police force who have long experience of handling the Old Firm fall-out. \"Unfortunately, when you go to these fixtures you'll hear some of the most horrific chanting of a sectarian nature which is aimed wholeheartedly at offending people from another religious persuasion,\" Campbell Corrigan, Assistant Chief Constable for Strathclyde Police, told CNN. \"Some of these songs include people singing about others' deaths or the death of iconic people in religion. We can't have that and I think there is now a need for us to underline our commitment that we're going to tackle this.\" In other quarters, however, the new law is raising anxiety.The responseOutside the red-brick facade of the 1920s-era main stand at Ibrox, the amiable John MacMillan admires the terraces that have provided such compelling drama down the years.MacMillan, the general secretary of the Rangers' Supporters Association, told CNN he fears the law could criminalize legitimate fans. \"I have no objections to legislation being brought in if it is going to be helpful but not if it is not enforcible.\"We are trying to get  these songs defined by the police and the Scottish parliament, but no one yet has been able to say here is a list of songs you shall not sing. What is acceptable and what is not -- will it be down to the police officer on the scene? We don't know where we are at the moment, it is a gray area.\"The singing and the chants are sometimes not very nice, from both sides I may add, and we just wish we could eradicate this from the game ... many good supporters and the clubs on both sides are making in-roads in this. \"I would just question whether there is any need for this legislation,\" MacMillan added.It is a view shared by former Celtic striker Andy Walker, who played for the side in the 1980s and 90s. \"All of the songs that are now deemed to be offensive were around when I was playing, we just used to let it wash over us,\" Walker told CNN under the watchful gaze of the Jock Stein statue that stands at the main entrance of the Celtic Park in memory of the manager who led the side to European Cup glory in 1967.\"Now we're in the era where people are desperate to be offended, we have a justice minister who thinks it offensive to make the sign of a cross or to sing the national anthem. I think there needs to be a lot of fine tuning before the new bill comes into play as I think the police use the Old Firm occasion to highlight issues that actually affect the whole of Scottish society: sectarianism, drinking and domestic abuse. I'm not sure what the players can do to make these better.\"The government may argue that through the use of CCTV and by working with the clubs involved it will be possible to successfully prosecute offenders, but some critics worry the move is being driven by forthcoming elections and that consequently the plans have not been thought through. The futureBack in The Louden Tavern, as punters dressed in football kits trickle in from the drizzle to catch Rangers' latest game on the television, Marshall shakes his head before speaking in a broad Glaswegian lilt [which is hard to do justice to in prose].\"I don't have a problem if they're banning the songs that should be banned, I do have a problem if they're trying to stop freedom of speech. Rangers fans have got their act together 100% and I don't think they get credit for that.\"It's just political correctness stuff. Rangers and Celtic fans all grew up with each other, go out with each other, marry into each other. I really don't understand what the politicians are trying to do. Maybe they're trying to deflect from other serious issues.\"I don't hear offensive songs in the Ibrox Stadium, and I mean that in the broadest sense, not just from the Rangers point of view.\"Despite their perceived differences, Marshall's apathy is shared wholeheartedly by Carberry at Bairds Bar, who turns down the music to the disappointment of his punters to speak to CNN. \"There are no Rangers supporters that come in here, so nobody will be offended by what is being sung. Same with Rangers' pubs.\"[But even if they do sing] what is acceptable and what is not? What is sectarian chanting and what is not? You have to remember a lot of these people are singing about their grandfathers and their time in the Troubles in Ireland.\"If you're singing about your grandfather in the IRA, or your grandfather in the UDF [Ulster Defence Force] ... if you sing that at a football match, you're going to be arrested for that? I think they're taking on too much.\"Celtic and Rangers football clubs, they depend on us and we don't want the wool to be pulled over our eyes. My friend Robert in the Louden, he's Rangers and I'm Celtic, and we love these games.\"There is maybe confusion among some as to what is offensive in the context of the Old Firm but for Marshall it is very simple.\"There's only one Celtic song that offends me,\"  Marshall says with a smile. \"It's when Celtic sing 'we are the champions!'\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/16/sport/football/sectarian-celtic-rangers-old-firm/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-16T10:42:16Z"}, {"id": "b0ea330c-9dce-576b-82a4-f80d1e931b47", "title": "Spain take commanding Davis Cup lead over France", "content": "Spain take commanding Davis Cup lead over FranceBy Updated 1959 GMT (0359 HKT) September 16, 2011 Rafael Nadal was in devastating form as he crushed Richard Gaquet in the opening rubberStory highlightsSpain lead France 2-0 after the opening singles rubbers in CordobaRafael Nadal and David Ferrer crush their opponents for the loss of just 10 gamesHolders Serbia trail Argentina 2-0 after Novak Djokovic withdraws from openerRafael Nadal and David Ferrer have put Spain on the brink of reaching the Davis Cup final after winning their opening two singles rubbers against France in convincing fashion.With the red clay of Cordoba suiting the Spanish duo perfectly, world number two Nadal -- showing no ill effects from losing the final of the U.S. Open to Novak Djokovic earlier this week -- set the ball rolling with a crushing 6-3 6-0 6-1 success over Richard Gasquet.And Ferrer doubled Spain's advantage, brushing aside Gilles Simon 6-1 6-4 6-1, to leave the four-times champions needing just a win in Saturday's doubles rubber to reach the final.The New Musketeers: France's fantastic four bid for Davis Cup gloryDespite searing heat, Nadal never allowed Gasquet time to get into their match, with the 10-time grand slam winner telling reporters he was delighted with his performance, considering he felt tired.\"That worked out well, I managed to play with a cool head and  do what I had to do throughout without losing concentration for a minute,\" said Nadal.\"There were moments where he helped me in making mistakes, not forcing me  to play long points.  My service was working well and that made me feel much more comfortable,\" added the Spanish No.1.A despondent Gasquet added:  \"Even a tired Nadal remains an exceptional player. I couldn't find a way past him. It's a defeat that  really hurts.\" Spain are attempting to reach the final for the third time in four years, and are favorites to take the trophy with two of the world's top five players amongst their ranks.

Some 80 years later, a new quartet of dashing young men is seeking to make a similar mark for France.Rene Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jean Borotra and Jacques \"Toto\" Brugnon were collectively unbeatable in the 1920s and early 1930s, dominating world tennis for almost a decade and establishing France as a major power in the sport.Named after a film version of the classic Alexandre Dumas novel, they ended U.S. supremacy in the prestigious Davis Cup teams competition, winning it six years in a row, and claimed 43 grand slam singles and doubles titles between them.The famous Roland Garros venue was built in Paris to host the following year's Davis Cup defense, after their famous victory in Philadelphia in 1927, and the French Open's men's singles trophy was named after them.After their demise, France had to wait 59 long years for another Davis Cup triumph, and it has been a decade since its last -- and ninth overall -- title. The last Frenchman to win a grand slam was Yannick Noah, in Paris in 1983.But a modern group of players, dubbed \"The New Musketeers\" by national sports newspaper L'Equipe, are striving to carve their own place in history.Gael Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon and Richard Gasquet were ranked in the world's top 13 after this month's U.S. Open, raising hopes that they can do better than when similarly placed as fresh-faced youngsters in 2008.JUST WATCHEDThe New Four Musketeers? ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe New Four Musketeers?  08:14Last year they took France to the final of the Davis Cup, losing to Novak Djokovic's Serbia, and this weekend they will travel to Spain, the home nation of the world No.1's predecessor Rafael Nadal, in a bid to again reach the title decider.Victory in Spain would likely set up a rematch with the Serbs, who host Argentina in the other semifinal -- with the champions undoubtedly fired up by Djokovic's U.S. Open triumph.\"When you don't have goals, when you don't have dreams, you are already dead. And this is a dream to win against Spain, in Spain,\" Tsonga told CNN's Open Court.In 2008, he lost to Djokovic in the Australian Open final, and this year he was beaten by the Serb in the Wimbledon semifinals before falling to Roger Federer in the last eight in New York.The all-action 26-year-old will spearhead France's challenge on clay in Cordoba, with world No. 7 Monfils ruled out due to a knee injury following his second-round exit at Flushing Meadows.While he and his colleagues have all been ranked in the top 10, they are painfully aware they must take the next step and win major titles before they can be talked of in the same way as their more illustrious compatriots.\"We have to win the Davis Cup first,\" Monfils said. \"And then, we try to win a grand slam ... but I think we need two or three Davis Cups and then maybe we can be like musketeers.\"The original foursome came from very different backgrounds, with Lacoste the most famous after establishing a fashion label once his glittering playing career had finished as well as inventing the steel tennis racket.\"Lacoste came from a very wealthy family,\" veteran American sports journalist Bud Collins told CNN. \"His father manufactured automobiles and he fell in love with tennis when he visited some relatives in England. His father said what are you going to do with yourself? Rene said: 'I want to be a tennis player.' His father said: 'Okay, but only if you can be the best.' \"Borotra moved into politics during World War Two, serving as General Commissioner to Sports in the Vichy government during the Nazi occupation before being arrested by the Gestapo in 1942. He lived to the age of 95 and founded the International Fair Play Committee.\"He was very gallant. He came from the Basque region and he was called 'the Bounding Basque,' \" Collins said.Cochet, nicknamed \"the Ball Boy of Lyon\" due to his role before becoming a successful player, was a world No. 1 like Lacoste and won seven grand slam singles titles.Brugnon was a doubles specialist who won 12 major titles in that discipline and died in 1978 aged 83 -- two years after they were simultaneously inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame.Of the new breed, most was expected of Gasquet -- a child prodigy who ranked as high as seventh in 2007, but has been rebuilding his career since a three-month absence in 2009 after testing positive for cocaine.\"Gasquet really had a rough time in that he was on the cover of magazines when he was nine, 10 years old,\" Collins said of a player who won the French Open mixed doubles title as a teenager in 2004. \"In France, they were so excited about him, but it didn't help him. Too much was expected. With the other guys, if they got together, they can pull the best out of him, because he should be the best player.\"Tsonga also tipped his colleague to continue his recent improvement.\"Richard is really, really talented. I think he has improved a lot these past couple of months. He's tougher in his head and I think he's going to play well in the future,\" he said. \"For him it was really difficult because he was really good really early, and all the pressure was on him. It's not easy when you are young. For me it was completely different and I think far more easy.\"Collins calls Tsonga, whose father is Congolese, \"probably the most exciting in the team.\" \"He just goes all out, diving for the ball, everything. At Wimbledon, losing the first two sets to Roger Federer ... that never happened before. Federer never lost the final-set match. And Tsonga is appealing, he looks like Muhammad Ali, he's terrific.\"Paris-born Monfils is another larger than life character, with his tattoos and dark, good looks from his Caribbean heritage -- his mother is from Martinique, his father Guadeloupe.\"Oh he's exciting,\" Collins said. \"When he's gonna lose, he jumps in the stands, he's gonna do push-ups -- dive for ball, which he certainly will.\"And he's got a comical outlook on things -- you know, he's a real prize. But then again, he's this guy who doesn't quite make it.\"Monfils said a passion for tennis is their biggest bond. \"We are all different -- really different because we come different parts of France,\" he said.\"Tennis is the only thing we have in common. We have tennis and that's it. For us it's a passion, I think, and this is why we are friends.\"All four players live in Switzerland, and Gasquet said their friendly rivalry is helping them to progress.\"They are my friends, so it's very good. We try to win the Davis Cup this year,\" the 25-year-old said. \"It's really nice to have them on the tour with me. It's a nice competition between us because when one is playing good, we try to do the same.\"While Monfils and Tsonga make headlines with their athletic, never-say-die displays, and Gasquet with his undoubted talent, Simon is the quiet achiever of the group.Ranked as high as sixth in 2009 and a nine-time winner on the ATP Tour, the slightly-built 26-year-old relies more on guile and baseline tenacity.\"He's very smart. He can run for hours and hours,\" Gasquet said. \"It's very hard to play with him on a baseline. \"You don't see him like Jo or Gael. He's not very muscular. But he's very, very tough to beat.\"Despite being aware of the feats of the original foursome from an early age -- statues commemorate the players at Roland Garros -- Monfils said he and his colleagues are not consciously trying to emulate them.\"Right now, I don't really think about 'to be a musketeer,' about the history. When you finish your career maybe you can say, 'Ah they were maybe the next musketeers.' Right now, you know, I don't think about it.\"Simon agrees.\"We manage to beat Rafa and Roger sometimes, and Novak also. And it's a good generation -- we are good players but still there are far better players than us on the tour,\" he said. \"And we just try to win one slam also, because the last one was Yannick Noah in 1983. It's 30 years ago. So, everybody wants us to do something very good. That's why they call us this (musketeers). But for sure we don't deserve it.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/16/sport/tennis/tennis-france-musketeers-davis-cup/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110914011913-monfils-leaps-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-16T14:30:16Z"}, {"id": "51186829-445a-5644-a08f-67584d2469b1", "title": "Bin Hammam fails with FIFA ban appeal", "content": "Bin Hammam fails with FIFA ban appealBy Updated 2021 GMT (0421 HKT) September 15, 2011 Mohammed bin Hammam was a FIFA Executive Committee member and head of the Asian Football Confederation until his ban.Story highlightsFIFA rejects Mohammed Bin Hammam's appeal against his life ban from footballQatari had been found guilty of breaching ruling body's code of ethicsThe 62-year-old was accused of trying to buy votes from Caribbean delegates He had been head of the Asian Football Confederation since 2002Former Asian football president Mohammed bin Hammam has failed to overturn his life ban in an appeal to world ruling body FIFA.The Qatari had hoped to be reinstated after being accused of bribing officials for votes in June's FIFA presidential election, but the Appeal Committee announced on Thursday that the suspension will stand.\"The appeal made by Mohammed bin Hammam has been rejected and the decision of the FIFA Ethics Committee confirmed,\" FIFA's website reported. \"The sanction of being banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) at national and international level for life has therefore been maintained.\"Ecuador's Francisco Acosta chaired a panel also comprising Argentina's Fernando Mitjans and Augustin Senghor of Senegal to hear the case.Bin Hammam said he now intended to pursue the matter with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where he feels he has a better chance of success.\"Of course, today's outcome from the Appeal Committee was not unexpected or  surprising.

He has maintained his innocence, despite being found guilty of offering money to Caribbean delegates.FIFA vice-president Jack Warner was also provisionally suspended for his part in the affair, but decided to resign rather than appear in front of the Ethics Committee.Bin Hammam, a former FIFA Executive Committee member, was chairman of the Qatar Football Association from 1992-96 and president of the Asian Football Confederation from 2002-11.He was a key figure as Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, despite accusations of corruption in the build-up to the FIFA delegates' vote on that tournament and the 2018 event, which went to Russia.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 87, "end": 106, "mot": "Mohammed bin Hammam", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 233, "end": 252, "mot": "Mohammed Bin Hammam", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 422, "end": 431, "mot": "Caribbean", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 537, "end": 556, "mot": "Mohammed bin Hammam", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 857, "end": 876, "mot": "Mohammed bin Hammam", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1187, "mot": "Ecuador", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1248, "mot": "Argentina", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1288, "mot": "Augustin Senghor", "types": ["politician", "mayor"], "type": ["mayor"]}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1299, "mot": "Senegal", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2091, "mot": "Sepp Blatter", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2285, "mot": "Caribbean", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2327, "mot": "Jack Warner", "types": ["director", "producer"], "type": ["director"]}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2563, "mot": "Qatar Football Association", "types": ["association"], "type": []}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2668, "mot": "Qatar", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2860, "end": 2868, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"president": 5, "association": 3, "team": 4, "politician": 1, "mayor": 1, "director": 1, "producer": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/15/sport/football/football-bin-hammam-fifa/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110915061143-football-bin-hammam-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-15T19:02:51Z"}, {"id": "569ff0f2-629b-5ef1-b5fd-744e6768933e", "title": "American Bradley poised to coach Egypt", "content": "American Bradley poised to coach EgyptBy Updated 1759 GMT (0159 HKT) September 15, 2011 Bob Bradley took over as U.S. coach in 2006 and led his team to the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup.Story highlightsFormer U.S. national soccer coach Bob Bradley accepts offer from Egyptian FAIts president Sameer Zahir says the 53-year-old is due in Cairo to sign contractBradley was sacked by U.S. Soccer in June after five years in the roleHe guided the U.S. to the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup in South AfricaThe Egyptian Football Association says it has reached an agreement  with Bob Bradley for the former U.S. coach to take control of the north African country's soccer team.The 53-year-old will take over from Hassan Shahatah, who left the position after Egypt failed to qualify for the 2012 African Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.\"We have chosen Bob Bradley to lead the national team after a lengthy negotiation with many foreign coaches,\" Egyptian FA president Sameer Zahir told CNN Arabic. \"We believe that Bradley is the most suited coach at this stage.\"We sent scans of the contract to him for review and comments and we expect to sign the contract officially with him here in Cairo in a couple of days.\"Zahir said that Bradley will be paid $35,000 per month, a deal which he said suited both the coach and the Egyptian FA's budget.Bradley was sacked by U.S. Soccer in June, having led his team to the final of the Gold Cup earlier the same month.

investigation of Saudi prince", "content": "Court reopens rape investigation of Saudi princeFrom Al Goodman, CNNUpdated 2127 GMT (0527 HKT) September 15, 2011 An investigation against Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, who was accused of raping a woman in 2008, has been reopened.Story highlightsA judge rules that a lower court must reopen the rape caseThe alleged victim says she was drugged and rapedShe identifies Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal as the perpetratorThe prince says he was in a different place at the time of the alleged attackA Spanish court has reopened an investigation into an allegation that one of the world's richest men, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, raped a young woman on a yacht on the island of Ibiza in 2008. But the prince says that not only is he innocent, but that he hasn't even been in Ibiza in more than a decade -- and that others have tried to impersonate him. The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it last year, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents.The woman appealed to the next highest court, the Balearic Island Provisional Court, which ruled that the lower court in Ibiza should reopen the investigation. According to court documents obtained by CNN, the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the Saudi royal family. A second document shows that the lower court has complied with the latest ruling, labeling Prince Alwaleed as a person an \"imputado,\" or someone \"under official investigation,\" and is seeking a statement from him. Being named an imputado is a step short of an indictment. The Saudi prince, a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such a News Corp., said in a statement that it was not until this week that he learned of the accusation.\"These allegations are completely and utterly false,\" said a statement from his investment firm, Kingdom Holding Co. \"The alleged encounter simply never happened.\"According to the statement, the prince doesn't even vacation in Spanish waters. Travel records show that he was elsewhere on the night of the alleged rape and in the company of others, the statement says. But Max Turiel, one of the lawyers for the alleged victim, says there is evidence that they want to the court to examine further. According to the court documents, the woman believed that her drink had been drugged. She sent a text message to a friend stating as much. She awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as Prince Alwaleed, according to court documents.Turiel told CNN that \"there were remains of semen\" that should be examined against the prince's DNA, as well as \"remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had.\"The evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape, the attorney said, so the alcohol was gone from her body, but not the drug or the DNA. Turiel said the alleged victim's mother could answer questions from CNN, but only through e-mail. He provided responses to CNN's questions that he said were from the mother. CNN cannot independently confirm that the message was from the victim's mother. \"She wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them,\" the message said. The message described the \"man or men\" who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her on board the yacht. Asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case, the mother said,  \"Part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that can't be bought nor scared off with threats.\"The young woman, a dual Spanish and German citizen, is now 23 years old, the e-mail said.

So we decided there would be a Spaniard hitting the first shot of the tournament, and who better than his good friend, Miguel Angel Jimenez.\"On Friday, Dyson and Donaldson play Bjorn and Jacquelin in game one, then Rock and Poulter face Sweden's Hanson and Noren.Jamieson and Fisher take on Colsaerts and Manassero, Foster and Westwood will again play Hansen and Molinari, while Clarke and Horsey

fourth term as FIFA chief in JuneFIFA president Sepp Blatter has denied reports that he plans to hand over power to UEFA chief Michel Platini before the end of his final four-year tenure as the head of world football's governing body.Blatter, 75, was elected unopposed for a fourth term in June after allegations of bribery and corruption led to the suspension of his sole opponent -- the former head of the Asian Football Confederation, Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar.Former France international Platini was voted in for a second term as head of European football's ruling body in March, and also serves as a FIFA vice-president.A report from ESPN on Tuesday claimed a deal had been struck between Blatter and Platini which would see the former European Footballer of the Year assume FIFA's top job in two years.\"The existence of a reported 'deal' between me and Michel Platini for the FIFA Presidency is pure nonsense,\" Blatter wrote on his official account on social networking site Twitter.\"The suggestion that I intend to stop my four-year mandate before its end is simply ridiculous.\"It has been a troubled 12 months for FIFA, with officials Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii both receiving bans from the organization in November 2010.Nigeria's Adamu and Temarii of Tahiti were accused of offering to sell their votes during the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.Adamu's appeal against his three-year ban will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on October 4. Bin Hammam, who was Asian president when Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament, was then suspended in May and subsequently handed a lifetime ban from football for allegedly offering bribes in exchange for support in June's presidential ballot.The 62-year-old denies the charges and his appeal hearing against the ban will be heard on Thursday.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 90, "end": 104, "mot": "Michel Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 291, "end": 295, "mot": "ESPN", "types": ["station"], "type": []}, {"start": 305, "end": 312, "mot": "Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 495, "end": 507, "mot": "Sepp Blatter", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 574, "end": 588, "mot": "Michel Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 885, "end": 903, "mot": "Mohamed Bin Hammam", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 920, "end": 926, "mot": "France", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 941, "end": 948, "mot": "Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "mot": "ESPN", "types": ["station"], "type": []}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1162, "mot": "Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1322, "mot": "Michel Platini", "types": ["president"], "type": []}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1437, "mot": "Twitter", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1602, "mot": "Amos Adamu", "types": ["official"], "type": []}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1689, "mot": "Nigeria", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1979, "mot": "Qatar", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2295, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"president": 8, "station": 2, "team": 3, "company": 2, "official": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/14/sport/football/football-fifa-blatter-platini/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/110914024105-fifa-blatter-uefa-platini-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-09-14T15:16:11Z"}, {"id": "79422164-bd06-58cc-95b8-c8178f83ac93", "title": "Libeskind's 'eagle' aims to lift Poland", "content": "Libeskind's 'eagle' aims to lift PolandBy Updated 0644 GMT (1444 HKT) September 14, 2011 JUST WATCHEDLibeskind's Polish 'eagle' ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLibeskind's Polish 'eagle'  02:57Story highlightsArchitect Daniel Libeskind's new building transforming WarsawResidential high-rise is Polish-born American's first project in PolandUnder construction opposite communist-era Palace of CultureSome hope that it will be symbolic of Poland's revivalA monument to communism, the Palace of Culture and Science dominates Warsaw's skyline. But soon the city's most prominent piece of architecture, a \"gift\" from Josef Stalin in the 1950s, will be joined by a building that will reflect the spirit of 21st century Poland.   Designed by Daniel Libeskind, Zlota 44 is the star architect's first project in the country of his birth. Currently under construction the 54-story luxury apartment building that is supposed to resemble an eagle, Poland's nation symbol, is situated opposite  the Palace of Culture and Science and close to one of the city's few synagogues that survived the Second World War.

It's up to the team to see [whether he will],\" AirAsia chief Fernandes told Reuters.Veteran Trulli signs new deal at LotusOn the issue of which racer would make way for Chandhok, Fernandes, who recently purchased English soccer team Queens Park Rangers, suggested Trulli would be the one to face the axe.\"Yes, I think Heikki [Kovalainen] is our number one driver, although Jarno's outqualified him [at the Italian Grand Prix].\"In response to Fernandes' admission, Chandhok said: \"It's obviously very nice to hear. He's the man who can make it happen. I've just got to wait and see what he decides.\"As a racing driver, the most emotional race is certainly your home grand prix. If I do get the opportunity to do it, it'll be fantastic, but as this moment it's a question only Tony can answer.\"To be an Indian driver on the grid for the first Indian Grand Prix would be magic. I've been very involved in the circuit; I've been visiting the site every month. To have the opportunity to drive would sort of complete that circle.\"Chandhok was given a drive ahead of the veteran Italian Trulli, who extended his contract with Lotus last weekend, for the German Grand Prix in July, where he finished in last place.While Chandhok admitted dropping a driver can create a difficult situation for the team, he insisted his relationship with Trulli has been unaffected.\"It's not ideal, there's no doubt about that ... I experienced it last year [at HRT], my drive was given to Sakon Yamamoto in the second half of the season. It's tough.\"When they put me in the car in Germany ... it's a very difficult situation. It can be awkward. But I have to say Jarno was fantastic. He offered his advice and support all through the weekend. I have to say hats off to him, he was a model professional.\"On his own future, Chandhok, who made his Formula One debut at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, made no secret of his desire to earn a full-time seat with Lotus. But he said any decision on his future with the team would be made by Fernandes.\"I need to sit and figure things out with Tony and where we are and where we see the future. I'd like to stay with Tony, with Lotus, and in the future race for them full-time.

Cook allegedly sent to the mother of a City playerGarry Cook has resigned as chief executive of English Premier League big- spenders Manchester City, after an email attributed to him appeared to mock the seriously ill mother of one of City's players.Cook, who had held the post for three years, initially denied sending the email to Dr Anthonia Onuoha, the mother of City defender Nedum Onuoha, who is suffering from cancer.However, following an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the email, Cook has now released a statement confirming his resignation, admitting to an \"error of judgment\".In the statement, posted on City's official website, Cook said: \"I am privileged to have held my position at Manchester City and to have experienced the opportunities that it has presented. \"The privilege is in part offset by the significant personal focus which has, at times, detracted from the magnificent achievements of those working at the football club.\"Cook continued: \"It is that factor, together with my error of judgment in this matter, that has prompted me to reach this decision, which I believe is in the best interests of the football club.\"City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak confirmed he had written a letter of apology to Dr Onuoha, after she had complained to the club about the content of the email, which was destined for City official Brian Marwood but sent to her in error.Dr Onuoha acts as her son's agent, and the email allegedly made reference to her ability to deal with a contract dispute between player and club, while suffering from the illness.Mubarak added: \"Gary's judgment in this matter should in no way lead to his accomplishments being overlooked. \"On every level, the club is unrecognizable from the organization which he inherited and our staff and supporter services, community outreach and commercial activity have seen unparalleled growth under his direction with yet more projects to be realized.\" City are currently second in the Premier League table, behind rivals Manchester United on goal difference, with both clubs having won all three of their matches so far.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 18, "end":

At this moment we do not know who caused the damage.\"I'm very disappointed for all the people here at the club who worked so hard over the past few days, through challenging weather conditions, to ensure the course was in playable condition. \"However, having said that, the same professionalism of the greenkeepers has ensured that the damage has been repaired so the tournament can go ahead.

Steven Gerrard has an infection in his ankle,\" Dalglish, 60, told a press conference.  \"Steven was in my mind for the game today but it just flared up. \"We are off tomorrow, so we'll have a more accurate idea on Monday or Tuesday when we return to training. We will be more accurate next week than what we can be now.\"Dalglish, who also managed the Anfield club between 1985 and 1991, praised the injured duo, while also expressing his delight at seeing his charges pick up three points without two of the team's most influential players.\"We are certainly much better with them in the squad than out of it,\" he said. \"They have done magnificently for this football club and they will continue to do magnificently for us too.\"They will continue to make a contribution, even now. I suppose it is a reflection on the strength of the squad when the two talisman figures are not playing and you still come and put on such a top performance.\"Gerrard and Carragher are products of the Liverpool youth academy, with both players part of the team which earned a penalty shoot-out victory over Italian side AC Milan in the 2005 European Champions League final.Dalglish will hope to have

Entitled \"The Hidden Alhambra,\" the project aims to expand the site for tourists, with an app. It will allow visitors to virtually explore delicate, closed-off areas on their iPhones, or on specially designed portable electronic tablets, as well as opening up new routes to related areas outside the complex. \"It is a site that gets many visitors, we can say that it's a major tourist destination,\" said Maria del Mar Villafranca, director of the Patronato de la Alhambra.\"For many years now, we have worked with a model that limits access to a certain number of visitors per day,\" she explained, saying \"Hidden Alhambra,\" is designed to further take the pressure off \"fragile zones.\"Hidden areas that the application will bring to light include an underground space beneath the palace of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as well as storage areas, towers and pavilions, according to Norma Barbacci, Program Director for Latin America, Spain, and Portugal at the World Monuments Fund.\"(Visitors will) be able to see images and video (on their iPhones) and get all kinds of information about these specific sites that are not open,\" she said.\"They are not able to walk down the stairs into the silos for example, but they can be close to them and get a lot of information,\" she continued.The app is currently being developed and augmented reality features have not been ruled out, said Barbacci. The first phase of information-gathering for the application, namely photographing the various sites, is being undertaken, according to Villafranca. They are aiming to have the app ready for the public by summer 2012.Virtual visitor experiences are an increasingly popular way of making delicate historic monuments accessible, said Barbacci. \"Once the technology began to improve, then we started looking at this as a way of promoting knowledge and caring for a building without trampling all over it,\" she said.But it's not all virtual work: The World Monuments Fund is also contributing $300,000 to the conservation of the Oratorio del Partal, an elaborate mid-14th century chapel built during the reign of Yusuf I.The conservation effort will include work on the roof, carved wood ceiling and decorative plaster work and will be incorporated into the \"Hidden Alhambra\" application.\"It's a very important part of the Alhambra, for its symbolic value being a part of the oldest area of the complex,\" explained Villafranca.It is part of a long-term plan of conservation works to other fragile areas of the complex that, she hopes, will make more and more of it accessible to visitors -- and continue to pique their interest in it.

helps Newcastle up to third", "content": "Ba treble helps Newcastle up to thirdBy Updated 2235 GMT (0635 HKT) October 31, 2011 Newcastle striker Demba Ba scores the second goal of his hat-trick in Monday's 3-1 victory over Stoke.Story highlightsDemba Ba scores a hat-trick as Newcastle win 3-1 at Stoke on MondayThe result lifts Newcastle up to third position in the English Premier LeagueNewcastle remain unbeaten after 10 matches, their best start in 15 yearsDemba Ba scored a superb hat-trick to help Newcastle United win 3-1 at Stoke City on Monday, a result that lifts the unbeaten Magpies up to third place in the English Premier League.Ba had been a target for Stoke manager Tony Pulis last season, but the Senegal international failed a medical when on the verge of joining the club and instead moved to West Ham, before joining Newcastle in the close season.And Pulis will have looked on in envy as Ba proved the star of the show in another impressive display from Alan Pardew's side.Newcastle went ahead in the 12th minute when Ba was left unmarked to head home Gabriel Obertan's cross from the right, and the same player doubled the visitors' advantage when netting from close range after Leon Best's mis-hit shot fell perfectly into his path.Stoke were handed a lifeline with 15 minutes remaining when Jonathan Walters scored from the penalty spot after Ba was adjudged to have pushed Peter Crouch in the area.But, just six minutes later, Newcastle themselves were awarded a spot-kick after a similar push by Robert Huth on Best, allowing Ba to confidently fire home for his hat-trick goal.The result continues Newcastle's remarkable start to the season, their best in 15 years. They now lie six points off leaders Manchester City, and just one point behind second-placed Manchester United, after climbing above Chelsea into third position.With 10 games gone, leaders City and Newcastle remain the only two unbeaten teams, while Newcastle have conceded just seven goals, the lowest in the division.Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the Spanish La Liga match on Monday, when Granada scored twice in the last 10 minutes to win 2-1 at Sevilla -- the home side's first defeat of the season.Manu Del Moral gave Sevilla a dream start when netting from close range after just 38 seconds, but Alexandre Geijo headed home an equalizer after Odion Igalho's shot struck the crossbar.And, in the final minute, Mikel Rico's left-foot strike handed the visitors only their second win of the season, taking them off the foot of the table in the process.Granada now lie on eight points, one point above bottom side Getafe, while Sevilla remain fifth on 17 points, eight points behind leaders Real Madrid and seven off second-placed Barcelona.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 16, "end": 25, "mot": "Newcastle", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 85,

GMT (0542 HKT) October 31, 2011 Roger Federer applauds his home crowd after winning his opening match in Basel.Story highlightsRoger Federer begins the Swiss Indoors tournament with victory over Potito StaraceFederer is seeded three in Basel behind Novak Djokovic and Andy MurrayEighth-seeded Serb Viktor Troicki is beaten in three sets by Marcos BaghdatisHome favorite Roger Federer is through to the second round of the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel after a straight sets victory over Italian Potito Starace on Monday.Third seed Federer, a four-time winner of the tournament, will now face either Brazilian Thomas Bellucci or Jarkko Nieminen of Finland after securing a 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 success against his world ranked 54th opponent -- who is known more as a clay-court specialist.Federer, who is behind Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in the seedings for the event, has not competed since playing for Switzerland in the Davis Cup in September, because of a succession of niggling injuries.And although he has won only one ATP Tour event in 2011, in Doha in the first week of the year, world number four Federer has reached the quarterfinals in 11 of the 13  tournaments he has played.\"My focus now is well at Basel -- and the next round is my next  priority,\" Federer told reporters.  \"Last year I won here and in London and also had match points in the Paris semis. \"I know  I can play well at the end of the season. If I'm going to make a ranking move, that's what it's going to take,\" he added.There was a surprise in Monday's other match, with eighth-seeded Serb Viktor Troicki going down 4-6 7-6 6-2 to 2005 runner-up Marcos Baghdatis in a marathon match lasting just 15 minutes short of three hours.Baghdatis had also beaten Troicki in the semifinals of the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur last month. Meanwhile, in the Valencia Open in Spain, Russian Nikolay Davydenko continued his comeback from injury with a superb 6-4 4-6 6-3 win over fifth seed Gilles Simon of France. The defeat almost certainly ends Simon's hopes of reaches the ATP World Tour Finals in London. He currently lies 12th in the standings with only the top eight qualifying.Davydenko will next meet Simon's compatriot,  Nicolas Mahut who beat  Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-6 (7-5) 6-2, in the last 16.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 86, "end": 99, "mot": "Roger Federer", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 303, "end": 317, "mot": "Novak Djokovic", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 322, "end": 326, "mot": "Andy", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 352, "end": 358, "mot": "Viktor", "types": ["painter", "illustrator"], "type": ["painter"]}, {"start": 424, "end": 437, "mot": "Roger Federer", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 553, "end": 567, "mot": "Potito Starace", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 686, "end": 701, "mot": "Jarkko Nieminen", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 705, "end": 712, "mot": "Finland", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 862, "end": 876, "mot": "Novak Djokovic", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 881, "end": 892, "mot": "Andy Murray", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 959, "end": 970, "mot": "Switzerland", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1088, "mot": "ATP Tour", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1378, "mot": "London", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1631, "mot": "Viktor", "types": ["painter", "illustrator"], "type": ["painter"]}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1697, "mot": "Marcos Baghdatis", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1905, "mot": "Spain", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1932, "mot": "Nikolay Davydenko", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2036, "mot": "France", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2100, "end": 2114, "mot": "ATP World Tour", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2131, "mot": "London", "types": ["association", "club"], "type": ["club"]}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2267, "mot": "Nicolas Mahut", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2309, "mot": "Guillermo Garcia-Lopez", "types": ["player", "tennis_player"], "type": ["player"]}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2359, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"player": 12, "tennis_player": 12, "painter": 2, "illustrator": 2, "team": 4, "company": 3, "association": 2, "club": 2}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/31/sport/tennis/tennis-basel-federer/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111031081129-tennis-federer-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-31T20:36:50Z"}, {"id": "b142881c-4b6b-51e9-ae28-d60ea5b74e98", "title": "Successful launch for Russian supply rocket", "content": "Successful launch for Russian supply rocketBy the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1608 GMT (0008 HKT) October 30, 2011 Story highlightsRocket launches successfully two months after another crashedLaunch \"sets the stage\" for next International Space Station crewAn unmanned Russian rocket successfully lifted off with a cargo of supplies for the crew of the International Space Station on Sunday, two months after a similar rocket crashed in Siberia. The Progress 45 freighter is slated to dock with the station on Wednesday with three tons of food, fuel, water and spare parts for the U.S., Russian and Japanese crew of the station. The vessel took off from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 4:11 p.m. (6:11 a.m. ET) and reached its preliminary orbit in nine minutes, the U.S. space agency NASA said. The launch follows a failed launch in August, when another Progress crashed into the Siberian wilderness. It was the first such crash in the craft's 30-year service history, but space officials said the station's three-member crew was never in any danger of running out of food or water.In a written statement, NASA's manned space flight chief, Bill Gerstenmaier, said the launch \"sets the stage\" for the next scheduled crew rotation aboard the ISS in November.

The cathedral, located in London's financial district, is one of the UK's top tourist attractions and staged the wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles in 1981.Contribute to CNN's \"Occupy\" Open StoryPolice attempted to forcibly remove protesters at the start of the standoff, but the Chancellor of St. Paul's, Canon Giles Fraser stepped in, voicing his support for the demonstrators.Days later, the cathedral closed its doors to visitors amid health and safety concerns over the encampment.Fraser, whose backing for the protest had made him a hero to some of those camping out in the shadow of St. Paul's, resigned last Thursday. The following day, the cathedral announced that \"with the greatest reluctance\" it would be taking legal action against the demonstrators. The cathedral reopened to visitors last Friday.Cathedral authorities have repeatedly said they will not support the use of force against activists.On Monday, Dr Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, reiterated that pledge.\"The last thing we would condone is the use of violence. The campsite has to disappear at some point, it has to be scaled down, but we do not want violence used in securing expulsions.\"Chartres also appealed for the message of the protests not to be forgotten.\"There is a huge danger that important issues are getting lost in the confrontation between cathedral and camp,\" he said, urging a \"reasoned and respectful debate.\"Protesters at the camp expressed their sadness at news of Knowles' resignation.\"It is a bit of a shame,\" one man told CNN. \"I think there has been a lot of pressure on him, and I suppose his position was untenable. It shows that there are still some good men left in the church -- or there were, until today anyway.\"\"I don't really know where this leaves us,\" another said. \"We didn't start this to upset the church, and we're not out to criticize them, so it is sad that two people have now left their jobs.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 261, "end": 265, "mot": "Dean", "types": ["leader", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 518, "end": 522, "mot": "Dean", "types": ["leader", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 657, "end": 663, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 694, "end": 708, "mot": "Graeme Knowles", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1477, "mot": "Michael Colclough", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1802, "mot": "London Stock Exchange", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1968, "mot": "Charles", "types": ["duke"], "type": []}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1994, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2145, "mot": "Giles Fraser", "types": ["priest"], "type": []}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2762, "mot": "Richard Chartres", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 3351, "end": 3354, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3504, "end": 3510, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3648, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3753, "end": 3761, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"leader": 2, "person": 2, "unit": 3, "bishop": 3, "company": 4, "duke": 1, "priest": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/31/world/europe/st-pauls-dean-quits/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111031034529-st-pauls-dean-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-31T16:50:14Z"}, {"id": "95d7fcae-5036-52f9-b4f8-ca875f1da1fe", "title": "Death toll from Turkey quake more than 600", "content": "Death toll from Turkey quake more than 600By the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1916 GMT (0316 HKT) October 30, 2011 Rescue workers carry the body of a victim in Ercis, Turkey, on Thursday, after an earthquake shook the area.Story highlightsMore than 4,100 people were injured in the quake last SundayThe town of Ercis was hard-hitMore than 230 people have been pulled alive from the rubbleThe death toll from an earthquake that struck eastern Turkey a week ago was at 601 as of Sunday, the Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency reported.More than 4,100 people were injured in last Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake, which struck Turkey's Van province.

We were both really fighting. \"Every game and every set was very close. Maybe I played better on the important points in the match but we both played some of our best here in Istanbul -- it was a final, so why not!\"And asked how this victory compared to her Wimbledon success, Kvitova told reporters: \"Winning a grand slam was a very big step. I don't know how it will be going home this time, but I think it will be similar.\"I will be world number two now and next season will be different. I may be the favorite all the time, and we will have to see how I cope with that.\"Third seed Azarenka of Belarus was gracious in defeat, adding: \"It's hard to lose, but I'm glad I lost to such a champion who deserved to win this week.\"Petra was amazing today. She really did a great job because I gave it my all. The crowd kept me fighting all the way through -- they have been amazing all week.The match turned in the opening game of the final set when Azarenka squandered two break points on the Kvitova serve.She then took advantage of Azarenka's disappointment by making the crucial break of serve in the next game, taking the first chance she had to achieve it.   It was Kvitova's sixth WTA Tour title of the season and in securing victory she became the first Czech to lift the coveted trophy since Jana Novotna in 1997.Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has moved up to seventh place in the race to reach the climax to the men's tennis season with a hard-fought victory over Juan Martin Del Potro in the final of the Austrian Open in Vienna.The top-seeded Frenchman beat the Argentine second seed 6-7 6-3 6-4 to put himself in line for a place in the ATP Tour finals in London next month.Del Potro is up to 11th place in the points chase and also still has a chance of reaching London, with more points to be had at next week's Valencia Open.

Meanwhile, American Bo Van Pelt powered to an emphatic six-shot victory at the Asia Pacific Classic in Malaysia -- a tournament co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour and Asian Tour.The 36-year-old carded a flawless seven-under-par 64 to finish clear of compatriot Jeff Overton (69), who trailed by just one stroke going into the final round, with Fredrik Jacobson of Sweden (68) a further shot behind in third position.It is only Van Pelt's second PGA Tour victory following his success in the 2009 U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee, while runner-up Overton is still waiting for his first tournament win after 161 events.

Bale put the home side ahead in the 19th minute when he fired home an angled drive after a long ball from the back was headed on by Emmanuel Adebayor.And a rampant Tottenham doubled their advantage 13 minutes later when Van der Vaart picked up a mis-hit shot from Ledley King to place the ball inside the far post.QPR fought back after the break and halved the arrears on the hour mark when Jay Bothroyd nodded home from close range.But Tottenham sealed their victory with a superb goal 18 minutes from time, with Aaron Lennon and Bale exchanging a series of passes outside the box before Bale curled home a shot that gave keeper Paddy Kenny no chance.  Manchester City still blaze a trail at the top of the table, with nine wins and a draw from 10 matches. They lie on 28 points, five clear of rivals Manchester United.Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham are all level on 19 points but Chelsea have played a game more and unbeaten Newcastle will move up to third position if they get at least a draw against Stoke on Monday night.

visitors had Torsten Oehrl sent off for a dangerous tacle with 14 minutes remaining.The win moves Cologne up to 11th place in the table with five wins and five defeats, but Augsburg are second bottom with just one win and eight points.Hamburg are just one point and one place above Augsburg after they drew 1-1 with Kaiserslautern on Sunday.The home side had Slobodan Rajkovic sent off in the 21st minute for elbowing Kaiserslautern captain Christian Tiffert and the visitors went ahead seven minutes before half-time through Pierre De Wit.But Peru striker Jose Paolo Guerrero levelled for the hosts in the second-half, although the point was enough to lift Kaiserslautern up a place to 13th in the table.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 18, "end": 27, "mot": "Tottenham", "types":

JuventusLevante's unbeaten run in Spain is over as they fall to a 2-0 defeat at OsasunaCaptain Antonio Di Natale returned from injury to score the only goal that gave Udinese a 1-0 win over Palermo on Sunday -- a result that keeps the pressure on Juventus at the top of Italy's Serie A table.Di Natale volleyed home Dusan Basta's cross seven minutes before half-time to leave Udinese on 18 points, one off leaders Juventus.And Lazio later joined Udinese on 18 points with a comfortable 3-0 success at Cagliari, thanks to goals from Senad Lulic, Miroslav Klose and Tommaso Rocchi -- who was netting his 100th goal for the club.Defending champions AC Milan are a further point back in fourth position after Saturday's 3-2 triumph at Roma.Meanwhile, bottom club Cesena sacked coach Marco Giampaolo after Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Parma left them still waiting for their first win of the season.In Spain's La Liga, Levante lost their first game of the season when they fell to a 2-0 loss at Osasuna.First-half goals from Juan Martinez and Alvaro Cejudo were enough to  deny Levante an eighth straight league victory and the result leaves Real Madrid a point ahead of rivals Barcelona at the top of the table.However, Cejudo was later sent off for a second bookable offence, leading to a nervy final half-an-hour for the home side.Levante remain third, two points behind Madrid after their first defeat in 10 games.In other matches, Atletico Madrid beat Zaragoza 3-1 to ease the pressure on coach Gregorio Manzano.A double from Adrian Lopez helped Atletico to their first win in eight matches, lifting them up to ninth place.Meanwhile, Racing Santander became the final team to win a match this season as they beat Real Betis 1-0 thanks to a Christian Stuauni penalty.Powered by

collects $2 million for his victory, the joint richest first prize in golfNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy is $2 million richer on Sunday after holding his nerve to beat  American Anthony Kim in a play-off at the Shanghai Masters at Lake Malaren.With both players sending their approach shots into the same greenside bunker, Kim missed his resulting three-foot putt, allowing world number three McIlroy to tap home from two feet to collect the richest current first prize in golf.\"It was a very important win. I'll be the first to say I have not won enough in the last four years as professional and could have done a lot more,\" McIlroy  told reporters.\"I was under pressure on the back nine and was one shot behind, so to be able to come back and win gives me a lot of satisfaction,\" added the 22-year-old.U.S. Open champion McIlroy had led the 30-strong field from the opening day, but a wayward final round saw him having to dig deep to card a level par 72 to finish on a 72-hole total of 288 (-18).That score tied with Kim's four-round effort, although a final round three-under par 69 ensured he was the only player to card four sub 70 rounds.Kim collected $750,00 for second place, with  American Hunter Mahan and Korean youngster Noh Seung-Yul  tied for third place five strokes behind the leading two.The tournament was unsanctioned by any major tour and was bankrolled by billionaire property tycoon Shi Jian.It is the joint largest single first prize ever awarded in golf, equaling the fund offered in the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa.That tournament is also unsanctioned, although since that event first offered $2m to the winner in 2000, the $4.8m prize fund is now spread more evenly among the 12 players competing.

A colorful character, Savile was as well known for his bright tracksuits, chunky jewelry and cigars as he was for his catchphrases: \"Now then, now then,\" and \"How's about that then?\" which were much copied by impressionists.Mark Thompson, Director-General of the BBC, said he was \"very sad\" to hear of Savile's death.\"From 'Top of the Pops' to 'Jim'll Fix It,' Jimmy's unique style entertained generations of BBC audiences. Like millions of viewers and listeners, we shall miss him greatly.\"Savile was also well known for his fund-raising efforts, and ran several marathons for charity. He was awarded a knighthood for his charitable work. Savile's body was found at his home in Leeds, northern England, on Saturday. Police were called to the scene, but said they were not treating his death as suspicious.

His attorneys have fought his extradition on procedural and human-rights grounds.Assange's lawyers have raised the possibility that Sweden would hand him over to the United States if Britain extradites him to Sweden. The prosecutor representing Sweden has dismissed that claim.The extradition case is not linked to Assange's work as founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, which has put him on the wrong side of the U.S. authorities.His organization, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables in the past year, causing embarrassment to the U.S. government and others. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.But the organization has come under increasing financial pressure in recent months, leading Assange to announce Monday that Wikileaks was temporarily stopping publication to \"aggressively fundraise\" in order to stay afloat.A financial blockade by Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union has destroyed 95% of WikiLeaks' revenue, Assange said.Many financial institutions stopped doing business with the site after it released the U.S. diplomatic cables late last year, and donations have been stymied.U.S. authorities have said disclosing the classified information was illegal and caused risks to individuals and national security.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 53, "end": 56, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 119, "end": 126, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 546, "end": 553, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 723, "end": 730, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 866, "end": 872, "mot": "Thomas", "types": ["politician", "judge"], "type": ["judge"]}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1009, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1446, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1941, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 2375, "end": 2379, "mot": "Iraq", "types": ["war"], "type": []}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2495, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2664, "mot": "VISA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2678, "end": 2684, "mot": "PayPal", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2744, "end": 2751, "mot": "Assange", "types": ["journalist"], "type": []}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3065, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"journalist": 9, "company": 4, "politician": 1, "judge": 1, "war": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/29/world/europe/uk-wikileaks-assange/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111029102606-julian-assange-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-29T10:12:39Z"}, {"id": "97385f83-add6-58be-bd69-e45a82cf0436", "title": "Vettel seizes pole at inaugural Indian GP", "content": "Vettel seizes pole at inaugural Indian GPBy Updated 1523 GMT (2323 HKT) October 29, 2011 Sebastian Vettel continues his, and Red Bull's dominance of Formula One with his 13th pole of the season in India.Story highlightsRed Bull's Sebatian Vettel secures 13th pole of season at Indian GP qualifying McLaren's Lewis Hamilton finishes second but pays three-place grid penalty  Webber elevated to front row of grid; Fernando Alonso starts Sunday's race in thirdRed Bull's Sebastian Vettel will start from pole position at Sunday's Indian Grand Prix after another impressive display in qualifying.

Hide Caption 5 of 5Story highlightsConcept designed to produce all food of a modern supermarket on one plot of landDutch architects say they will use mix of technologies to create artificial growing climatesScheme designed to reduce food production and transportation emissions Crop scientist has doubts about creating artificial microclimates Big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands, but a group of Dutch architects hope to change that with the \"Park Supermarket\" -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place. The firm behind the proposal, Rotterdam-based Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, intends to produce everything from risotto rice, to kiwis to Tilapia fish all on one 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Randstad, Holland's largest metropolitan area. In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way.The land, which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession, cuts across the city fringes of Rotterdam and The Hague, serving a potential customer-base of over one million people, according to Van Bergen Kolpa Architects. \"The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes,\" said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the \"Park Supermarket\" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November. \"The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical. Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses,\" he said. But how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north European city? According to van Bergen, it's not as far-fetched or futuristic as it sounds.\"The main differences between a Mediterranean and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening, \" he explained. \"To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop,\" So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of \"snake walls\" and \"climate pylons.\"According to van Bergen, \"snake walls\", made from clay, curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds, while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day. Annotated illustration, climate-control methods \"They used this method in the 18th century gardens of eastern Germany's Potsdam, so the king could grow grapes to make wine that tasted as good as the French stuff,\" he said.  \"Climate pylons\" are a more modern method of trapping heat. Van Bergen says they simply rain down a fine mist of water from high up, creating clouds that act like vapor roofs, stopping warm air from disappearing into the sky.View of existing site in RandstadHowever, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth. \"In this case, we'll pump geothermal energy -- heat stored deep in the lower soils -- up to the top using underground pipes filled with water,\" he explained. \"This technology is used in football stadiums to stop the pitches freezing over and more recently it's being used to heat homes.\"Van Bergen concedes that the pumps and electric-powered lights that artificially extend daylight hours will require an additional input of energy, but claims that it will all be met by local renewable sources. Read related: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissionsThe Park Supermarket was commissioned by planning officials from the South Holland Province, and plans are afoot for a small test site to be up and running by the end of this year.If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report. \"The dominant food-production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,\" said Dr Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at London's City University. \"It needs oil to make the fertilizer, oil for the farm, oil for the food processing, oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops,\" he added.Van Bergen says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs, while stimulating local industry and social bonds.\"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe,\" he said. However, the Park Supermarket concept does not appeal to everyone. \"Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing,\" said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College. \"However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates. \"We know that we are suffering from climate change, with one area enduring long wet spells while another goes through a prolonged drought. I wonder if we really ought to be exploring technologies that seek to control our already unpredictable weather cycles.\" Canon is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests.\"Every time you raise humidity, you raise disease affectability -- because where you have good conditions for growth you also have good conditions for disease to grow.  I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way,\" she warned. Finally, while Canon says she appreciates what van Bergen and his team are trying to do, she doubts that the system could be replicated on a wider scale.\"In my experience, it takes a lot of resources to create a relatively small microclimate. This means land that could otherwise be used for growing native crops is taken up with technology -- whether it be rows and rows of snake walls or climate pylons or whatever,\" she said. For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production.\"I'm not a preacher of any one form of agriculture,\" he said. \"Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one. \"But this is about more than sustainable, non-intensive farming, it's about cultivating community ties and giving new meaning to a space on the edge of the city that is currently being used for very little else.\" Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [], "counts": {}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/29/world/europe/holland-park-supermarket/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-29T13:13:20Z"}, {"id": "a2a8c24d-025a-5d5e-bccd-1bf91203209f", "title": "Report: Turkey suicide bomb attack kills 3, injures 20", "content": "Report: Turkey suicide bomb attack kills 3, injures 20By the CNN Wire StaffUpdated 1518 GMT (2318 HKT) October 29, 2011 JUST WATCHEDSuicide bomber kills two in TurkeyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSuicide bomber kills two in Turkey 01:47Story highlightsA female suicide bomber killed two other people and herself, reports sayAt least 20 people were hurt in the attackBingol province is in eastern TurkeyA female suicide bomber killed two people and herself in an attack Saturday in Turkey's eastern Bingol province, the Turkish state-run Anatolia news agency reported.Bingol Governor Mustafa Hakan Guvencer said 20 people were also hurt when the woman detonated her explosives in the town of Bingol, the agency said.

It wasn't long though before the left-handed Czech soon found her rhythm grinding down the spirited Stosur with a series of forehand winners to take the second set and level the match. Kvitova then raced into a 4-0 lead in the deciding set before Stosur pulled one break back but it was too late to save the match. The 22-year-old Azarenka, meanwhile, enjoyed much the better of a series of baseline rallies with her Russian opponent, and despite her serve not being in the best order ran out an easy winner.

The home side continued to dominate possession but Arsenal hit back in the 36th minute when Aaron Ramsey threaded the ball through to Gervinho who selflessly squared the ball back for van Persie to side-foot past Petr Cech.  Chelsea had a goal disallowed two minutes later with Ramires being ruled offside, but earned a deserved halftime lead when John Terry bundled the ball home from a corner kick in the 45th minute.Arsenal were far from finished though and hit back four minutes after the break as Alex Song played in Andre Santos who squeezed a shot underneath Cech to level the scores at 2-2. Six minutes later, Theo Walcott gave the Gunners the lead -- unleashing a fierce shot inside Cech's near post after outwitting three Chelsea defenders. A 25-yard strike from Mata restored parity for Chelsea in the 80th minute, but van Persie put Arsenal ahead again five minutes later, pouncing on a mistake by John Terry to slot home his second before lashing home his third in injury time to seal a remarkable win. Manchester United bounced back from the 6-1 battering from their city rivals last weekend edging past Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park. Havier Hernandez was on hand to side-foot home from a Patrice Evra cross in the 19th minute to give United the lead after they had made a bright opening to the match. Everton battled their way back into the match and came close to an equalizer -- Leighton Baines hitting the crossbar from a free-kick, while David De Gea saved smartly from Leon Osman. But despite the pressure, United held firm to cement second place in the table behind leaders, Manchester City who enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.Edin Dzeko opened the scoring for City in the 52nd minute with  Aleksandar Kolarov adding a second 15 minutes later. City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompany was sent off in the 75th minute for a challenge on Kevin Doyle -- the resulting penalty was converted by Stephen Hunt.But Adam Johnson (who came on for Dzeko midway through the second half) netted in injury time to ensure Robert Mancini's side maintained their five-point lead at the top of the table.First half goals from Charlie Adam and Andy Carroll proved enough for Liverpool who beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at The Hawthorns.Liverpool were awarded a penalty in the 9th minute when Luis Suarez was bundled over in the box -- Adam making no mistake with the spot kick. Suarez was involved again in the second, setting up Carroll who poked a shot past advancing West Brom keeper Ben Foster. Despite a host of chances in the second half Liverpool couldn't extend their lead, but the win lifts them to fifth. West Brom are 13th with 11 points.   Norwich City came from two goals down to earn a 3-3 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers -- a result which keeps Steve Kean's side in the bottom three. Norwich are in eighth place.Sunderland also came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw against Aston Villa. Goals from Villa's Bulgarian midfielder Stiliyan Petrov (20th minute) and Richard Dunne (85th minute) were canceled out by Connor Wickham, who scored seven minutes before half time and Stephane Sessegnon who stole a point for Sunderland seconds before the final whistle.    Swansea City continued their promising start to season with 3-1 over struggling Bolton Wanderers. The result moves them up to 10th place. Bolton, meanwhile, are second from bottom with six points, one point ahead of Wigan who suffered their third home defeat of the season losing 2-0 to Fulham. Goals from Clint Dempsey and Moussa Dembele lift Martin Jol's side up to 15th.

Higgins, a 70-year-old poet and politician, was elected Ireland's new president on Saturday.Considered an elder statesman, the Irish Labour Party candidate-turned-president elect is a former government minister.He is to be Ireland's ninth head of state and is scheduled to be inaugurated on November 11, one day after President Mary McAleese leaves office.McAleese has been head of state 14 years, completing two seven-year terms. The other six candidates -- including former Irish Republican Army commander Martin McGuinness -- have all conceded defeat.McGuinness's campaign had been dogged by questions about his past ties to the IRA, an armed group that fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland but has since renounced violence.

As such, the PFA, the union that represent players in England and Wales, insisted that a fine of two week's wages was the maximum allowed.In a statement on their official web site City said: \"Manchester City is disappointed by the apparent PFA conflict of interest evident in this process. \"Carlos Tevez has been personally represented throughout by the PFA chief executive, on whose considerations the club has been informed that the PFA has made its decision. \"Manchester City has been in constant dialogue with the PFA since September 28th. Today's PFA decision is a departure from the club's understanding of that dialogue.\"Without recourse to the PFA decision available, the maximum two-week fine provided for in standard player contracts will now be applied in relation to the misconduct of Carlos Tevez.\"Tevez has not featured for City since the Bayern game in late September when the row with manager Roberto Mancini erupted on the touchline.The Italian said after the game that Tevez had refused to come on as a substitute and also said the striker would \"never\" play for the club again.Tevez insisted the incident was a misunderstanding, claiming he refused to warm-up because he had already done so. Tevez has been forced to train alone since the incident.In his absence City have built up a five point lead at the top of the Premier League and recorded a 6-1 win at rivals Manchester United last weekend.

is in fact by the 17th century Spanish portraitist.The change of attribution means it is likely to sell for between $3.2m and $4.8m -- 10,000 times its original estimate.Auction house staff say the painting's owner was stunned at the news.Vel\u00e1zquez experts Dr Peter Cherry, Professor of Art History at the University of Dublin, and Carmen Garrido, Head of Technical Services at the Prado Museum in Madrid were among those to study the picture.Writing in the Spanish arts magazine ARS, Cherry said: \"the particularized likeness and recognisably lifelike texture, weight and colours of the fleshy face speak of the actual encounter between subject and painter; while the style and technical brilliance of the representation itself betrays its author.\"The identity of the painting's subject is not known, but it is thought the balding, bearded man in a stiff, starched collar may be Juan Mateos, King Philip IV of Spain's master of the hunt.The Vel\u00e1zquez portrait will now go on display to the public at Bonhams London saleroom on Sunday December 4, ahead of the company's Old Master Paintings auction on Wednesday December 7, where it is expected to be the star lot.\"Vel\u00e1zquez is one of the greatest geniuses in the entire history of Western art,\" said Bonhams' Old Masters expert Andrew Mckenzie. \"The discovery of this lost treasure is a once-in-a-lifetime experience -- it is tremendously exciting to be able to bring it to the world's attention.\"We expect there to be great interest from around the globe as works by this master so rarely come to auction.\"Powered by

2011 Lionel Messi celebrates scoring the opening goal in Barcelona's 5-0 defeat of MallorcaStory highlightsMessi scores hat-trick inside 30 minutes in 5-0 mauling of MallorcaReal Madrid go top of La Liga with a 1-0 win at Real Sociedad Juventus earn 2-1 win over Inter Milan; AC beat Roma 3-2A first-half hat-trick by Lionel Messi helped Barcelona to a 5-0 win over Mallorca at the Nou Camp on Saturday. The Argentina international opened the scoring after 13 minutes with a spot kick after Emilio Nsue had handled the ball in the penalty area. Eight minutes later he tapped in after a miscue from Adriano before completing his hat-trick on the half-hour mark, expertly guiding home a cross from Dani Alves. Twenty-year-old Issac Cuenca scored his first senior goal for the club five minutes into the second half, while Alves rounded things off with a superbly taken goal in injury time. A ninth-minute goal from Argentina striker Higuain earned Real Madrid a 1-0 win at Real Sociedad on Saturday night. The win puts them one point ahead of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with 25 points, although Levante will depose them if they win at Osasuna on Sunday.Two goals from Frenchman Sofiane Feghouli and one for Aritz Aduriz earned fourth-placed Valencia a 3-1 win over Getafe, while Villareal were comfortable 2-0 winners over Rayo Vallecano -- Bruno Soriano and Borja Valero scoring goals in either half.  Meanwhile in Italy, Juventus remain top of Serie A after a 2-1 win at Inter Milan on Saturday. All the goals came in an action-packed first half with Juve taking an early lead thanks to a 12th minute strike from Mirko Vucinic.Maicon equalized for the hosts in the 28th minute, but it wasn't long before the visitors were back in front -- Claudio Marchisio scoring in the 33rd minute.The win gives Juve a two-point lead at the top of Serie A, but that will be reduced to one point if Udinese beat Palermo on Sunday.    Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as AC Milan beat Roma 3-2 at the Stadio Olimpico to send the reigning league champions up to second in the table.  The Swedish striker opened the scoring in the 17th minute before Nicolas Burdisso equalized for the home side in the 28th minute. Alessandro Nesta restored Milan's lead two minutes later before Ibrahimovic made it 3-1 in the 78th minute to all but clinch three points.   Bojan Krkic pulled one back for Roma three minutes before the end but it wasn't enough to deny the Rossoneri vital away points.Napoli lost ground with the league leaders as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at Catania.  Edinson Cavani had given Napoli the lead after just 27 seconds, but goals from Giovanni Marchese in the 25th minute and Gonzalo Bergessio three minutes after the break were enough to earn the home side all three points. Napoli played half the match with 10 men after Mario Santana was sent off shortly before half time.

His motives were unknown.The gunman managed to hit the Embassy building several times, according to a statement from the Embassy. He also shot a police officer assigned to protect the Embassy, hitting him in both kneecaps; the officer later underwent surgery for injuries that were not life-threatening, a police spokesman said.The Embassy was immediately secured when the shooting began and all of its employees are safe, the statement said.Bosnia's TV1 broadcast footage of a bearded man in a long dark jacket pacing in front of the Embassy with an automatic weapon.

Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. The agency gave an alert about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata in southern Italy, as well as the eastern part of Sicily.Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been \"isolated, accessible only by sea\" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told the news agency ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it.That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday.\"The situation is much better compared to yesterday,\" Betta said. Italy's Defense Ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here.Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, an ANSA report said.  ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow.The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train services in Liguria have been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 77, "end": 80, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 956, "end": 975, "mot": "Corriere della Sera", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1240, "mot": "Servizio Meteorologico", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1674, "mot": "Angelo", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1706, "mot": "ANSA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2329, "mot": "ANSA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2348, "mot": "ANSA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2938, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 5, "newspaper": 1, "unit": 1, "leader": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/28/world/europe/italy-flooding/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111028124554-italy-flood-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-28T12:27:25Z"}, {"id": "120362f3-f948-5eb0-afbd-897a772354a7", "title": "Girls given equal rights to British throne under law changes", "content": "Girls given equal rights to British throne under law changesBy Laura Smith-Spark, CNNUpdated 2022 GMT (0422 HKT) October 28, 2011 JUST WATCHEDPrincesses to get fair share of throneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPrincesses to get fair share of throne 01:25Story highlights Expert: Plans for William and Catherine to start a family make reforms urgentThe law changes would apply to any children of Prince William and CatherineUnder the changes, a first-born girl would take the throne ahead of a younger brotherThe law changes must still be approved by individual Commonwealth governmentsSons and daughters of British monarchs will have an equal right to the throne under changes to the United Kingdom's succession laws agreed to Friday, British Prime Minister David Cameron said.The leaders of the 16 Commonwealth countries that have the queen as head of state approved the changes unanimously at a Commonwealth of Nations summit in Australia, he said. The individual governments of those 16 countries still must agree to the changes for them to take effect.The constitutional changes would mean a first-born girl has precedence over a younger brother. They also mean that a future British monarch would be allowed to marry a Catholic.The laws would apply to any future children of Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, who married this year.Speaking alongside his Australian counterpart Julia Gillard in Perth, Cameron described Friday's agreement by the heads of government of the 16 nations as \"something of a historic moment.\"Attitudes have changed fundamentally over the centuries, he said in a televised address, and outdated rules should evolve with them.\"The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he is a man, or that a future monarch can marry someone of any faith except a Catholic -- this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we have become,\" he said.\"Put simply, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a little girl, that girl would one day be our queen.\"Cameron also referred to plans to scrap the Act of Settlement, a law passed in 1701 which bans the UK monarch from marrying a Catholic. It was intended to ensure that Protestants held the throne and remained head of the Church of England.\"Let me be clear: the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England, because he or she is the head of that church, but it is simply wrong that they should be denied the chance to marry a Catholic if they wish to do so,\" Cameron said. \"After all, they're already quite free to marry someone of any other faith.\" Cardinal Keith O'Brien, leader of the Catholic Church in Scotland, said he welcomed the planned reform.Overheard on CNN.com:'King Henry must be spinning in his grave\"I am pleased to note that the process of change, which I hope will lead to repeal of the Act has started and I look forward to studying the detail of the proposed reforms and their implications in due course,\" he said in a statement.Richard Fitzwilliams, royal commentator and a former editor of International Who's Who, told CNN that the changes were vital if the monarchy was to adapt with changing times.He said that \"for decades, since the 1950s, there's been talk of doing this and nothing's actually happened,\" he said -- probably in part because it did not affect Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry.\"Now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have said they want to start a family, this makes it urgent,\" he said.While the constitutional change has to be made by parliament in the United Kingdom and the other 15 countries that have the queen as head of state, it is supported by Buckingham Palace, he said.The situation where a younger brother would take precedence over a first-born sister is discriminatory under European law, he points out.The legal changes relating to the marriage of the monarch to a Catholic will have to be handled sensitively, he added, because of the monarch's role as head of the Church of England, and involve several acts of parliament going back to the 17th and 18th centuries.Britain is not the first European nation with a hereditary monarchy to take steps towards gender equality in its laws of succession.Denmark changed its rules to make them gender neutral in 1953, enabling the current monarch, Queen Margrethe, to succeed to the throne.Sweden followed suit in 1980, three years after the birth of Crown Princess Victoria, the current successor to the throne.

The trillion-plus-dollar economy, Asia's largest after Japan and China, is set to host the world's fastest sport this weekend.The subcontinent's inaugural Grand Prix comes barely a year after India earned international scorn for all the chaos and corruption allegations that plagued the 2010 Commonwealth Games staged in New Delhi.That event was marred by a host of problems including athletes' alarm over the shoddy construction and condition of their quarters, while a pedestrian bridge leading to the main Jawarhalal Nehru Stadium collapsed two days before the competitors were due to arrive.In April this year, India's federal police arrested the Games' chief organizer, Suresh Kalmadi, for suspected corruption.Kalmadi, who was involved in bringing F1 to India through his former role at the Indian Olympic Association, was jailed for allegedly buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. He was also suspended by the political party with which he was an MP.But promoters of India's first F1 race hope their $400 million project will repair the damage done to the country's reputation. \"The world's perception of India is going to change after the Grand Prix and people will forget what happened because of the Commonwealth Games,\" said Jaiprakash Gaur, founding chairman of Jaypee Group that built the Buddh International Circuit.JUST WATCHEDFormula One racing comes to IndiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormula One racing comes to India 02:06A few weeks ago, a fleet of Mercedes-Benz cars whizzed media crews around the 5.125-kilometer circuit, giving them a glimpse of what Indian businesses lauded as a stirring example of their competence.\"Corporate India is completely capable, and they are capable of executing projects of world class, which has been demonstrated by the F1 track, which looks certainly as one of the best in the world,\" said Ajay Sharma, a senior director with the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.\"This is great news for the country because the investors are also now excited that this is the country where, you know, all the happening things are happening,\" he told CNN.Sharma's lobby group predicts that investments in the motorsport infrastructure could potentially fuel overall economic prosperity by some $10 billion over the next decade. It says the arrival of global sporting bodies -- themselves seeking a foothold in emerging markets -- is an ideal opportunity for international brand-building by Indian businesses. However, not everyone is as excited about the event when so many Indians live in abject poverty.\"The contrast between the rich and the poor is very large in India,\" said Arun Kumar, a professor at the Center of Economic Studies and Planning at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\"Here, about 40% of our people live in extreme poverty without even basic facilities. In a sense, it sounds very cruel that the nation is spending a large amount of its wealth on such sports.\"The track complex, complete with stands and team enclosures painted in the colors of India's flag, was built by private developers on land acquired from farmers, who later alleged they were short-changed for their properties.Last week, the country's Supreme Court froze 25% of ticket revenue after a litigant challenged government tax waivers on the race. Critics are questioning the taste of putting up such high-octane shows in a country where a quarter of its billion-plus people still lives on less than a dollar a day. With organizers struggling to sell out the event, ticket prices for Sunday's race have already been slashed. The most expensive has dropped from $715 to about $300, and the cheapest from about $120 to $60. But even the lowest amount is equivalent to the monthly wages of tens of thousands of Indians.\"What do we consider to be a nation? A nation means having a concern for all citizens. In this day and age when advertising has become so large, expectations have risen and these lavish displays only increase discontent,\" Kumar said. \"And the ruling elite in the country is backing such displays, which shows it's becoming more callous.\"In cricket-crazy India, some also accept that motorsport, though exciting, is too new to them.\"I don't think we Indians are much into Formula racing,\" admits Jai Sethi, a New Delhi resident. \"And I guess how the race is being done, who wins it, what the rules are and who the teams are have to be known to the Indian public.

Hide Caption 3 of 4 Photos: Herge and his famous creation, TintinA new film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and titled \"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn,\" is released in the UK this week. Hide Caption 4 of 4Story highlightsTintin as much an explorer and amateur archaeologist as a reporter'Tintinologist' Jean-Marc Lofficier lists his favorite archaeology-themed Tintin adventuresHerge interested in anthropology and archaeology, influenced by discoveries of the dayHerge's famous boy reporter certainly liked to stray from his native Belgium. Tintin's official profession may be that of a reporter, but he is just as much an explorer and archaeologist, dashing around the world to chase down ancient artifacts in addition to nefarious villains and a good story. Carrying on a venerable tradition of filmic archaeologists and adventurists such as Indiana Jones, the new Tintin film by Steven Spielberg, entitled \"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn,\" mixes the story-lines of several of Herge's books and follows Tintin and friends hunting for centuries-old treasure. \"Herge was always interested in exotic locations and travel around the world,\" said Paris-based 'Tintinologist' and comic-book artist Jean-Marc Lofficier.\"Keep in mind that he comes out of the tradition of (French author) Jules Verne, whose characters are always traveling around the world and finding lost civilizations and incredible ruins,\" he continued. Lofficier, who is co-author of the Pocket Essential guide to Tintin, spoke to CNN about his favorite historical escapades and archaeological \"MacGuffins\" from the classic series of comic books, beloved around the world by adults and children alike. 'The Cigars of the Pharaoh'Published in 1934, this is the first Tintin adventure to have featured an archaeological premise, Lofficier says, explaining that the storyline was \"clearly influenced\" by the discovery of the tomb of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun by Howard Carter in 1922.The plot begins with Tintin meeting an archaeologist looking for the lost tomb of a mysterious Pharaoh and is driven by the appearance of a number of cigars bearing mysterious -- seemingly ancient Egyptian -- symbols. Moving from Egypt to Arabia and on to India, Lofficier says the book is \"a catalog of archaeological myths and popular clich\u00e9s from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\"'The Broken Ear'This book, published in 1937, charts the hunt for a South American idol that is stolen from the Museum of Ethnography in Brussels. \"It's kind of a fetish object, a small wooden idol with a broken ear,\" said Lofficier. \"We find out that there is some kind of a precious stone hidden in the idol and everyone is fighting over it.\"\"Herge is using the complications of having various people try to seize the idol as a pretext for a travelogue around South America,\" says Lofficier, explaining that Herge was as interested in anthropology as he was archaeology, with Tintin coming into contact with native South American tribesmen along the journey. 'Prisoners of the Sun'Published in 1949, \"Prisoners of the Sun\" is a sequel to \"The Seven Crystal Balls,\" in which a group of explorers are struck down with an unexplained illness after discovering the tomb of a mummified Inca in Peru -- a storyline which echoes the supposed Tutankhamun \"curse\" that was much-discussed at the time. In \"Prisoners of the Sun,\" Tintin and friends are charged with rescuing their friend Professor Calculus from native tribesmen, who are angry about what they see as the desecration of their culture and are eventually revealed to be last remaining descendants of the Incas.  \"At the end of the day, it is about the right of the Inca civilization to (protect their) culture,\" said Lofficier. \"Herge presents the other side of the issue, which is that these civilizations deserve to be respected -- which considering the time period, is very forward-thinking.\" In the end, Tintin manages to secure the release of the kidnapped explorers and in exchange promises never to reveal the location of the remaining Incas. 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'Moving from ancient civilizations to pirates and buried treasure, \"The Secret of the Unicorn\" and \"Red Rackham's Treasure\" form the basis for the script of \"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn.\"Both chart Tintin and various other parties' attempts to unearth the lost loot of 17th century pirate, Red Rackham.\"Half of (The Secret of the Unicorn) is actually a flash-back to the great days of the pirates,\" said Lofficier, explaining that Tintin's friend Captain Haddock is the ancestor of the sea captain who killed Rackham all those years ago.  At the end of \"Red Rackham's Treasure,\" after a voyage in a submarine resembling a shark, the treasure turns out to be hidden in Haddock's ancestral home. 'Flight 714'\"Flight 714 is the penultimate Tintin book and has a very strange ending,\" explains Lofficier. The book, published in 1968, is strongly influenced by the science fiction of the time, said Lofficier, and features an incredible plot device in which the gods worshiped by the ancient peoples of a volcanic island Pulau-Pulau Bompa are revealed to have been extraterrestrials. \"We are left with an ongoing mystery, (presented as) the ultimate answer to archaeology,\" said Lofficier.

year.Story highlightsLewis Hamilton and Sergio Perez handed three-place grid penalties at Indian Grand PrixHamilton and Perez failed to notice double yellow flags at Buddh International CircuitFerrari's Felipe Massa set the fastest time, narrowly edging out Red Bull's Sebastian VettelBernie Ecclestone has cast doubt over the future of the Korean Grand PrixMcLaren's Lewis Hamilton has been hit with a three-place grid penalty for ignoring a safety flag in Friday practice ahead of Sunday's inaugural Indian Grand Prix.Sauber driver Sergio Perez was handed the same sanction after race stewards said the duo failed to notice \"double waved yellow flags\" at the end of the day's opening session, in which 2008 world champion Hamilton had set the fastest time.The flags were waved after Williams' Pastor Maldonado experienced engine failure at turn 16 of the newly-opened Buddh International Circuit, with the penalty proving the latest setback in a season which has seen Hamilton win just two races.Ferrari's Felipe Massa led the field with a lap of one minute 25.706 seconds, 0.088 secs ahead of Red Bull's double world champion Sebastian Vettel.Massa's Spanish teammate and two-time drivers' champion Fernando Alonso was third fastest, with Hamilton, 26, eventually having to settle for fourth.Vettel's fellow Red Bull driver Mark Webber was fifth fastest at the New Delhi track, ahead of Hamilton's British compatriot and 2009 title winner Jenson Button.Renault's Vitaly Petrov, the only Russian driver in the sport, finished practice in 11th, but has been handed a five-place grid penalty for a collision with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher at the Korean Grand Prix two weeks ago.Meanwhile, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has cast doubt over the future of the race in Korea after it emerged the event organizers were seeking a reduction in the hosting fee.It was announced Tuesday a race will be held in New Jersey from 2013 onwards, with a further grand prix in the U.S. to be held in Austin, Texas from next season. Russia is also set to make its F1 bow in 2014.Current regulations limit the maximum number of rounds in an F1 season to 20, with Korea, which has a deal to host a race until 2016, earmarked as a venue which could potentially make way.\"There are lots of things in life you can't afford, and you don't have to have them,\" Ecclestone was reported to have said in British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. \"And it took us long enough to negotiate with them in the first place.\"It was strange. They didn't really get behind it. That was a disappointment because it was a big enough effort to get it on in the first place.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 84, "end": 91, "mot": "McLaren", "types": ["manufacturer"], "type": []}, {"start": 208, "end": 216, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 439, "end": 447, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 450, "end": 459, "mot": "Sebastian", "types": ["politician", "leader", "prince"], "type": ["prince"]}, {"start": 905, "end": 913, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1078, "mot": "Buddh International Circuit", "types": ["facility"], "type": []}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1159, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1285, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1319, "mot": "Sebastian", "types": ["politician", "leader", "prince"], "type": ["prince"]}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1431, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1500, "mot": "Red Bull", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1579, "mot": "Hamilton", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1838, "mot": "Michael Schumacher", "types": ["diplomat", "ambassador"], "type": ["ambassador"]}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1926, "mot": "Bernie Ecclestone", "types": ["businessman"], "type": []}, {"start": 2223, "end": 2229, "mot": "Russia", "types": ["team"], "type": []}, {"start": 2848, "end": 2856, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"team": 10, "manufacturer": 1, "politician": 2, "leader": 2, "prince": 2, "facility": 1, "diplomat": 1, "ambassador": 1, "businessman": 1, "company": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/28/sport/motorsport/motorsport-f1-india-hamilton/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111028111302-hamilton-india-practice-28-10-11-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-28T12:04:49Z"}, {"id": "4309e064-fc9a-55e1-8f59-d1796681b2a6", "title": "English football must move quickly to deal with racism claims", "content": "English football must move quickly to deal with racism claimsBy Updated 1919 GMT (0319 HKT) October 28, 2011 JUST WATCHEDRacism in international footballReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRacism in international football 10:09Story highlightsRacism claims in English football must be dealt with quickly, experts tell CNNPiara Powar and Darren Lewis say allegations surrounding John Terry are bad for gameTerry accused of a racial slur against a fellow player during English Premier League matchChelsea and England captain Terry strongly denies the allegationsEnglish football must act swiftly to get to the bottom of racism allegations surrounding Chelsea and England captain John Terry if they are to prevent the Premier League's reputation being tarnished.That's the view of Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe, who told CNN that the English game could suffer if the ongoing saga isn't resolved quickly.Both the English Football Association (FA) and the Metropolitan Police are investigating claims that Terry aimed a racial slur at Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during an ill-tempered match last weekend.Video footage posted online sparked controversy after it appeared to show Terry shouting a racist comment at Ferdinand after an incident in the match.Terry has categorically denied any wrongdoing and Chelsea's manager, Andre Villas-Boas, claimed on Friday the affair was \"a big misunderstanding.\"But Powar told CNN World Sport: \"With the TV coverage comes a global awareness of what's going on in English football. \"If you look at the markets the Premier League is particularly interested in -- Asia, Africa, the U.S. -- these are not places that take to seeing racial abuse on the field of play amongst the assets very well.\"Darren Lewis, a journalist for English newspaper the Daily Mirror, said the FA must deliver their verdict on the case before Terry leads England into a friendly against world champions Spain next month.He said: \"We have perhaps the highest profile player in the English game at the center of an alleged player on player racial abuse incident and its not looking good for English football at the moment.\"It has to be pointed out that Terry categorically denies a racist slur but people are making their own minds up from the YouTube footage that they have seen.\"Next month we have a prestige friendly between England and Spain and the onus is on the FA is to address this and resolve it before then. If they don't we have the prospect of the England captain appearing in that match under the cloud of racism. \"It would be a terrible thing, the entire build up and match would be dominated by it. It's a global audience that watches the English Premier League, it's a global audience that watches friendlies just like that one. The onus is on the FA to resolve this.\"The Terry incident comes after Manchester United's Patrice Evra accused Liverpool's Luis Suarez of racism in a Premier League match between the two clubs earlier in October.Suarez has categorically denied any wrongdoing and on Friday Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish said he wanted a quick conclusion to the incident.He told a press conference: \"We would rather have it done and dusted, out in the open.

The City of London Corporation, which runs the capital's financial district, said it had legal grounds for action because the 200 or more tents were impacting roads in the area.   Stuart Fraser, the City of London Corporation's chairman of Policy and Resources, said: \"We have no problem with a peaceable 24-hour protest by people without tents -- provided the highway is fully usable -- but campsites and important highways don't mix.\"He told CNN it could take three to four months for the legal process to unfold.A statement from St. Paul's said it had asked the protesters to leave peacefully but that legal action \"has regrettably become necessary\" given their refusal to move on.   \"The Chapter only takes this step with the greatest reluctance and remains committed to a peaceful solution,\" it said.Protester Spyro Van Leemnen told CNN: \"We are very disappointed to see that the church decided to take the legal route.\"The church should stand by (us). Jesus himself kicked out the moneylenders from the temple and now we see this system of Christianity collaborating with the moneylenders to evict people from their doorstep.\"He said the Occupy London group was consulting a lawyer on how to respond with its own legal action.He urged church leaders and London Mayor Boris Johnson to join activists and people from all faiths in a debate to be held on the cathedral steps Saturday.The cathedral, which lies in the heart of the financial district, reopened to worshipers and visitors with a special service Friday, a week after it closed its doors citing health and safety concerns over the tent city outside.The decision to take court action comes a day after a senior cleric, Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser, resigned over concerns that St. Paul's planned to evict the Occupy London protesters, in a step which could lead to violence.The week-long closure of one of London's centers of worship, also a landmark tourist attraction that usually welcomes thousands of paying visitors a day, has led to much soul-searching among senior clergy there. The Dean of St. Paul's, the Right Rev. Graeme Knowles, said St Paul's believed in the right to peaceful protest but had asked the protesters to move on peacefully. It was consulting lawyers on measures it could take, including court action, he said, to resolve the situation.Knowles said the cathedral was able to reopen after changes were made to the way the tent city, which sprang up 13 days ago, was laid out, giving better access.\"The staff team here have been working flat out with the police, fire brigade and health and safety officers to try to ensure that we have confidence in the safety of our worshipers, visitors and staff which will allow us to reopen,\" he said in a statement Wednesday.The activists, who say their aim is \"to bring about real social and economic justice for every single person in society,\" welcomed the announcement that the cathedral would reopen. They launched their own newspaper, Thursday, the Occupied Times of London.In an interview after his resignation, Fraser told the Guardian newspaper that the issue was not about his sympathies with the protesters but the possibility that violence could be used against peaceful protest. \"I cannot support using violence to ask people to clear off the land,\" he told the paper. \"For me I could imagine Jesus being born in the camp.\"London's Mayor Johnson used more forceful language in an interview with London's Evening Standard newspaper, calling for new laws to prevent tent cities \"erupting like boils\" across London, and telling the activists: \"In the name of God and Mammon, go.\"This week's closure was the first time in decades that St. Paul's had shut its doors to visitors.Designed by architect Sir Christopher Wren, the domed cathedral was built between 1675 and 1710. A church has stood on the site near the banks of the River Thames for more than 1,400 years.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 789, "end": 795, "mot": "Fraser", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1049, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1443, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1493, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1537, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1565, "mot": "Jesus", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1849, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1888, "mot": "Boris Johnson", "types": ["politician", "mayor", "secretary"], "type": ["mayor"]}, {"start": 2302, "end": 2314, "mot": "Giles Fraser", "types": ["priest"], "type": []}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2661, "mot": "Dean", "types": ["leader", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2706, "mot": "Graeme Knowles", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 3649, "end": 3655, "mot": "Fraser", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 3936, "end": 3941, "mot": "Jesus", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 4415, "end": 4421, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 4516, "end": 4524, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"politician": 3, "company": 3, "unit": 4, "leader": 3, "mayor": 1, "secretary": 1, "priest": 1, "person": 1, "bishop": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/28/world/europe/uk-cathedral-protest/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-28T10:34:53Z"}, {"id": "5c65a5de-6a94-5ecf-a160-30183bdf410e", "title": "Q&A: Who can inherit the British throne", "content": "Q&A: Who can inherit the British throneBy Dave Gilbert, CNNUpdated 1407 GMT (2207 HKT) June 25, 2013 JUST WATCHEDWith royal baby, three wait for throneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWith royal baby, three wait for throne 02:28Story highlightsThe marriage of William and Catherine brought the succession back into focusSons and daughters of British monarchs will now have an equal right to the throneRoman Catholics are still barred from holding the crownBoth the UK laws and those of 15 other Commonwealth states will have to be amendedBritain's Prince William and his wife Kate are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage, the palace announced Monday.But until 2011, any daughter born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would not have enjoyed an equal right to inherit the British throne.

Successive UK governments have failed to find parliamentary time to debate proposals to change the law. A spokesman at UK Prime Minister David Cameron's office said it had often been thought of as \"too thorny and complicated to deal with quickly.\" The marriage of William and Catherine in April 2011 brought the issue back into focus. David Cameron referred directly to the couple in his speech to Commonwealth leaders, saying the succession rules were \"outdated.\"  \"The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he's a man... this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we've all become,\" he said.White House to royal couple: Congrats!So what was agreed?The leaders of the 16 Commonwealth countries that have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state unanimously agreed that sons and daughters of British monarchs will have an equal right to the throne. They also agreed that a future British monarch can marry a Roman Catholic -- something that is currently banned.What was the historical basis for the old rules?The tradition of favoring the male heir -- called male primogeniture -- goes back many centuries and can be seen in the extensive family tree of the British monarchy.But a key law which governs the way British monarchs are chosen is the 1701 Act of Settlement which has its roots in the religious strife of the age. The official British Monarchy website explains that the act was designed to secure the protestant succession to the throne. Royal commentator and former editor of the International Who's Who, Richard Fitzwilliams, explained that this has been a divisive issue ever since the English Tudor King Henry VIII split with the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th Century, leading to decades of religious persecution.The Act of Settlement decreed that no Roman Catholic or anyone married to a Catholic could hold the English crown. This is now to be amended so that an heir to the throne can still be monarch even if they marry a Catholic.The British Monarchy website gives two examples of the current royal family who were removed from the line of succession because they married Roman Catholics -- George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, and Prince Michael of Kent.  How are William and Catherine affected?The changes mean that if the couple's first born is a girl, she will eventually become queen. Previously, a younger son would have taken precedence. However, this could be many years in the future. Prince Charles is first in line to the throne when Queen Elizabeth II dies, and his son William would ascend after his reign. David Cameron's speech makes it clear that the new rules are not retroactive, so Prince Charles's eldest sibling, Anne, will not be in line to the throne in front of her younger brothers Andrew and Edward. It also means that any heir born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge can marry a Catholic and retain the crown.What isn't changing?The British sovereign is also head of the Church of England -- part of the Anglican church -- and retains the title Defender of the Faith. David Cameron said at the 2011 meeting that \"the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England because he or she is the head of that church.\" This would currently bar a Catholic holding the crown.Prince Charles caused controversy in 1994 when he said in a TV interview that he would rather be seen as \"defender of faiths\" to include Catholic subjects of the sovereign which he described as \"equally as important as the Anglican ones or the protestant ones.\" He went on to list other faiths as also being equally important.What happens next?David Cameron explained in his speech to Commonwealth leaders that \"for historic reasons\" the UK legislation needed to be published first but the necessary measures would be implemented at the same time across the Commonwealth.However, the process is a complex one. The Downing Street spokesman said that in addition to the Act of Settlement, many other archaic laws would have to be amended -- these include the Bill of Rights 1689, the Coronation Oath Act 1688, the Acts of Union and the Royal Marriage Act 1772.Each of the 15 other Commonwealth members would then have to amend their own legislation.So which countries are affected?The Commonwealth consists of 54 independent states, most of which have ties to the United Kingdom, but Queen Elizabeth II is head of state to only 16 of them including the UK. Those nations are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.

Story highlights Cathedral officials say it will reopen Friday after safety concerns were metGiles Fraser had been supportive of the protest camp outside St. Paul'sOccupy London protesters set up a tent camp outside St. Paul's 12 days agoA senior figure at London's landmark St. Paul's Cathedral stepped down Thursday, apparently over concerns that it planned to evict anti-capitalist protesters camped outside. Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser had been supportive of the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest camp, the presence of which led the cathedral to close its doors last week for the first time in decades. \"It is with great regret and sadness that I have handed in my notice at St. Paul's Cathedral,\" Fraser said on Twitter Thursday, but did not give a reason why.However, he told the London Evening Standard newspaper he was stepping down from a post he had held since 2009 because he believed the cathedral was set on a course of action that \"may lead to violence.\"The Dean of St. Paul's, the Right Rev. Graeme Knowles, said the cathedral would be \"very sorry to see him go\" but did not elaborate on his decision.Cathedral leaders announced Thursday that St. Paul's, a major tourist attraction and historic center of worship in the heart of London's financial district, will reopen Friday with a service at 12:30 p.m.A statement on the Occupy London website said the protesters were \"deeply moved\" by Fraser's resignation.\"From the moment Occupy London arrived at St. Paul's Churchyard he respected our right to protest and defended it,\" it said. \"For that we are very grateful, as he ensured that St. Paul's could be a sanctuary for us and that no violence could take place against peaceful protesters with a legitimate cause -- challenging and tackling social and economic injustice in London, the UK and beyond.\"Knowles said Wednesday that changes had been made to the way the tent city, which sprang up outside 12 days ago, was laid out, giving better access.\"The staff team here have been working flat out with the police, fire brigade and health and safety officers to try to ensure that we have confidence in the safety of our worshippers, visitors and staff which will allow us to reopen,\" he said in a statement. Knowles said St. Paul's believed in the right to peaceful protest but had asked the protesters to move on peacefully. It was consulting lawyers on measures it could take, including court action, he said.Last Friday, the dean said the cathedral, which normally welcomes thousands of visitors each day, would be closed until further notice because of \"practical and safety issues,\" including a fire risk from stoves used by those camping out.The Evening Standard quoted London Mayor Boris Johnson Thursday as calling for new laws to prevent tent cities \"erupting like boils\" across London, and telling the activists: \"In the name of God and Mammon, go.\"Speaking to London's LBC Radio, the mayor said he supported the right to protest in the city but that it was time to think about the damage the Occupy camp was doing to businesses and worship at the cathedral, as well as London's economy.A separate piece written by the Bishop of London, Dr. Richard Chartres, for the Evening Standard said the reopening of St. Paul's would be a victory for common sense.He urged the protesters to disband, saying their original message had been all but lost amid media reports on other aspects of the protest. St. Paul's would organize a debate on the issue if they left peacefully, he offered.St. Paul's Cathedral, designed by architect Sir Christopher Wren, was built between 1675 and 1710. A church has stood on the site near the banks of the River Thames for more than 1,400 years.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 169, "end": 190, "mot": "London Stock Exchange", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 346, "end": 352, "mot": "Fraser", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 676, "end": 688, "mot": "Giles Fraser", "types": ["priest"], "type": []}, {"start": 723, "end": 744, "mot": "London Stock Exchange", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 954, "end": 960, "mot": "Fraser", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 969, "end": 976, "mot": "Twitter", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1228, "mot": "Dean", "types": ["leader", "person"], "type": ["person"]}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1273, "mot": "Graeme Knowles", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1662, "mot": "Fraser", "types": ["politician"], "type": []}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2295, "mot": "fire brigade", "types": ["department"], "type": []}, {"start": 2958, "end": 2971, "mot": "Boris Johnson", "types": ["politician", "mayor", "secretary"], "type": ["mayor"]}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3158, "mot": "LBC Radio", "types": ["station"], "type": []}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3436, "mot": "Richard Chartres", "types": ["bishop"], "type": []}, {"start": 3804, "end": 3815, "mot": "Christopher", "types": ["saint", "martyr"], "type": ["saint"]}, {"start": 3857, "end": 3863, "mot": "church", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 3958, "end": 3966, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 4, "politician": 4, "priest": 1, "leader": 1, "person": 1, "bishop": 2, "department": 1, "mayor": 1, "secretary": 1, "station": 1, "saint": 1, "martyr": 1, "unit": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/27/world/europe/uk-cathedral-protest/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111027043334-st-paul-s-cathedral-signs-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-27T15:10:31Z"}, {"id": "b679aa06-ab3d-5351-a24c-c701c88cb768", "title": "Marco Simoncelli: The motorcycling star who shined so bright", "content": "Marco Simoncelli: The motorcycling star who shined so brightBy Tancredi Palmeri, for CNNUpdated 1524 GMT (2324 HKT) October 27, 2011  Photos: Funeral of Marco SimoncelliIn memory of Simoncelli \u2013 Mourners lay flowers in Marco Simoncelli's hometown of Coriano as a sign of their respect for the former Honda rider.Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Funeral of Marco SimoncelliRemembering an idol \u2013 Motorsport fans gather outside the theater in the Italian town.

Unexpectedly, he thanked everyone -- those who helped Marco, the journalists, the thousands of fans queuing in the rain for a last farewell. His father is dying inside, and we should be comforting him, but instead we wait for his words to try to comfort ourselves. He has every reason to be upset, but instead he talks to us serenely, thanking life for giving him such a shining son.Paolo tells us how positive Marco was to everyone, \"and that he was beautiful even when I saw him dead.\" This is another gift we get from Marco Simoncelli -- joyful, smiling, happy when alive -- and now his family are still inspiring us to love life even when anger would be justified.Kate Fretti has been Marco's girlfriend since 2006. It's known that motorsport offers lots of \"fun'\" for drivers. Marco once said: \"Lots of girls come close, it would be so easy ... But I feel good with Kate, why would I mess everything up?\" They were building their house. Not the one of a millionaire. It is right beside Marco's parents' house, with a huge table to have dinner with all their friends. Despite all his money, they were a normal boy and girl of our times, trying to make their way. \"Marco didn't give a damn about money,\" Paolo Simoncelli said. \"He used to say: 'Can we buy food without looking at the price? So we are rich.\"He had a unique talent for expressing his emotions on a bike. He was very open to the world, even if it sometimes landed him in trouble.Back in May, after being heavily accused by Spanish press and riders of causing Dani Pedrosa to crash and break his collarbone, several death threats were addressed to Simoncelli from Spain ahead of the Catalunyan GP. At first, his Honda team and his family hid those threats from him, knowing they would shock his sensitivity. A few days before traveling to Barcelona, they revealed what was going on at a dinner. Marco was scared, but most of all staggered. His girlfriend said that, while listening to his father, Marco reduced the wine cork he was holding into tiny pieces. He kept on repeating: \"Why do they threaten me? What I have done wrong?\"While a public figure might usually dismiss those threats as from some maniac, Marco instead questioned himself. He couldn't understand why this could happen.But he was not only a genuine guy, he was also a formidable rider. Valentino Rossi is the legend, while Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo are the leading lights now. But maybe nobody, not even Valentino, has the sense for overtaking and for going over the limit like Simoncelli. That's why he was so criticized during his battle with the Spanish riders. But the same things were said 30 years ago to Gilles Villeneuve and 25 years ago to another Formula One star, Ayrton Senna. \"He is dangerous, he is crazy, someone will soon be hurt,\" they said of Simoncelli.But Simoncelli was a real racer -- and that means overtaking. Carlo Pernat, his manager and a significant figure in the world of MotoGP racing, described him as: \"A driver not of this time, from an era where racing meant trying every second to go past your rival.\" Obviously, a rider like this made his rivals nervous. Seven-time world champion Rossi, who loved Simoncelli as a brother, explains it best: \"Having a duel one-vs-one with Marco, it's like if you're going to have a punch against a huge guy: you already know you will always be the one beaten up.\"Italy had a gem, a pure talent with a pure soul. That's why the tears can't stop. His mother Rossella was at home at Coriano, Rimini, when Marco died. A couple of hours after his death, some of his friends gathered outside the house, crying together. She walked out, the greatest pain inside her but dignity on her face, and told them: \"No guys, stop crying. Marco would be so sad to see you fall apart. You always laughed with him, just remember the good times you had together.\"Marco Simoncelli is unique for us because -- despite how Italians feel aggrieved by his fate -- when we see him again on TV, when his interviews are replayed, we can't help but laugh. He was the hilarious cousin always in a good mood, the one you were looking forward to spend time. Funny, mamma mia, so funny. He was our \"Super Goof.\" Would you ever imagine a celebrity saying this: \"When I wake up early, for example when I have jet-lag, I run to jump in the bed of my parents while they sleep. I'm crazy for that.\" His nickname was actually \"Super Sic.\" And now his last farewell has been given, bikes escorted his coffin to the church, and 60,000 people attended his funeral on Thursday.It was broadcast live by three Italian channels, while in some cities thousands of bikes gathered for a parade ended by loud roars in his honor. Spanish fans plan to go to 2011's final MotoGP race in Valencia next weekend with thousands of curly bushy wigs like his hair.The best way to say goodbye is remember him with his own words. Words of a kid who was always surprised by the world, and made us smile so much (see picture gallery above).

Azerbaijan's \"city in the sea\" is the site of the world's first offshore oil well. One hundred and twenty kilometers out into the Caspian Sea, it's still actually within the capital Baku's city limits.Built in 1949, in Soviet times, Oil Rocks is a huge feat of human engineering. Three hundred kilometers of roads, 256 individual oil wells: this is no small operation. Two thousand people live and work here every day, working on a one-week shift rotation. Catering to the needs of its citizens, it even has its own museum and restaurants.Oil Rocks was the world's first attempt to tap into offshore reserves, buried beneath the water. Stalin commissioned the project, before going on to develop Russia's Siberian oil operations.One drilling platform after another was built and linked up with piers, the foundations formed by sinking ships 1,000 meters to the seabed.Flying there by helicopter, a thin film of oil over the water is visible -- evidence of the biggest industry in the Caspian Sea region: hydrocarbons. Local oil and gas reserves have been exploited over the years by the Persians, the Ottomans, the Soviets and now Azerbaijan itself. In Azerbaijan the oil has been flowing for centuries. In 1900, half of the world's production of crude oil came from this corner of the former Soviet Union. This country is now a transit point for energy exports from the whole Caspian Sea region. Oil Rocks is a fascinating link in the chain of eastern supply and western demand.Today the site is operated by SOCAR, Azerbaijan's state oil company. A new well was drilled just this month. Over 60 years after it was built and Oil Rocks is still producing oil and gas, still contributing to the Azeri economy.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 569, "end": 575, "mot": "Stalin", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2166, "mot": "Stalin", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 3033, "end": 3038, "mot": "SOCAR", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 3242, "end": 3250, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"leader": 2, "company": 2}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/28/world/europe/baku-oil-rocks/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111027044325-baku-379-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-28T10:06:07Z"}, {"id": "b84e822e-8a55-519f-9260-2b69c7f98b70", "title": "Qatar's Al Sadd overcome adversity  to make Asian football history", "content": "Qatar's Al Sadd overcome adversity  to make Asian football historyBy Updated 1158 GMT (1958 HKT) October 27, 2011 Uruguayan coach Jorge Fossati celebrates after guiding Al Sadd to the Asian Champions League final.Story highlightsAl Sadd the first Qatari football club to reach Asian Champions League finalJorge Fossati's team beat South Korea's Suwon Bluewings 2-1 on aggregateAl Sadd will face Jeonbuk Motors, after Koreans beat Saudi Arabia's Al IttihadThe final will be at Jeonbuk's Jeonju World Cup Stadium on November 5Al Sadd coach Jorge Fossati praised his team for overcoming a \"big injustice\" to become the first Qatari football club to reach the Asian Champions League final.The former Uruguay coach saw his Doha-based team record a 2-1 aggregate victory over Suwon Bluewings after losing 1-0 to South Korea's two-time Asian champions on Wednesday, despite having key players suspended following an ill-tempered first leg last week.\"Of course we are very, very happy,\" the 58-year-old told the Asian Football Confederation website. \"To overcome them was difficult. There were many problems and yet we won and that's why I am happy.\"You know we had to play this game with big injustice. We didn't have some players because of non-football issues. In this situation, we tried to do our best with whatever resources we had.\"Five players and coaches were suspended for the match at the Sheik Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium, after a mass brawl broke out following Al Sadd's controversial second goal in the 2-0 win in Suwon on October 19.The fighting erupted after Senegal striker Mamadou Niang scored his and Al Sadd's late second goal while Suwon's players were tending to an injured teammate, presuming play had been halted.Former Marseille forward Niang was later sent off and missed the return leg along with Ivory Coast attacker Kader Keita and goalkeeping coach Suhail Saber Ali, while Suwon were missing Macedonian striker Stevica Ristic and coach Ko Jong-Su.But even without their star players, Al Sadd held on after Oh Jang-Eun had given Suwon a 1-0 lead with a sixth-minute volley, as Khalfan Ibrahim hit the Koreans' crossbar with a vicious long-range shot before halftime.Earlier on Wednesday, South Korea's Jeonbuk Motors advanced to the November 5 final courtesy of a 5-3 aggregate win over Saudi Arabia's Al Ittihad.After a 3-2 away success last week, the 2006 Asian champions won 2-1 thanks to first-half goals from Brazil forward Eninho. Al Ittihad's only response was a late consolation goal from former Bordeaux winger Wendel Geraldo, after both teams had been reduced to 10 men. Al Ittihad, the 2004 and 2005 champions, suffered an early blow when Naif Hazazi -- the scorer of both first-leg goals -- was sent off in the 11th minute for a headbutt, while Jeonbuk substitute Krunoslav Lovrek received a second yellow card late in the match.Jeonbuk coach Choi Kang-Hee was pleased his team would have home advantage at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium.\"We got what we wanted,\" said Choi, a former Suwon coach. \"We are at home for the final and that is an advantage for us. The lead we took from the first leg gave us some breathing space at home but we knew well that Al Ittihad are a very good team.\"We expected them to come at us strongly and we were ready for that. Eninho's goals were a big help but we still had work to do and were able to get the result we needed.\"Jeonbuk will attempt to keep the Champions League title in South Korean hands for the third year in succession, after Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma's victory in 2010 and the Pohang Steelers' 2009 triumph.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "mot": "Qatar", "types": ["association"],

Story highlightsGreece says it seized 555 yachts and collected $4.7bn in fines for tax evasion in 2010The finance ministry estimates it is owed $56bn in uncollected taxesCNN has been told how citizens pay a \"tip\" to tax officials to reduce the amount they payThe Greek government says it seized 555 yachts last year in a clamp-down on tax evasion. It is an astonishing statistic but just one of many eye-popping numbers coming from Greece as it tries to reform its economy and emerge from the debt crisis that is threatening the rest of Europe.According to the Greek finance ministry, the yachts were taken because the privately-owned vessels were licensed for professional use in order to escape a tax.  In addition to the seizures, the ministry said it clawed back \u20ac3.4 billion ($4.7 billion) in fines for tax evasion in 2010, and in the first nine months of 2011 the tax receipt is \u20ac39 billion ($54 billion).Greece certainly needs the money. Before the European deal to write down Greece's debt to 120% of economic output, figures from the European Commission put the country's projected debt for 2011 at nearly \u20ac353 billion ($488 billion).The Greek government recognizes that tax evasion and the system of tax collection has been a long-term problem. The finance ministry estimates that it is owed \u20ac40 billion ($56 billion) in uncollected taxes going back decades, but now thought impossible to recover due to bankruptcies and deaths.Greek MP Elena Panaritis, an economics expert who advises Prime Minister George Papandreou, recently described evasion as \"rife,\" estimating that more than 30% of income taxes went uncollected.\"The real culprit is an institutionalized, broken system and inefficient management of the public sector and the overall revenue system,\" she wrote in The Globalist in May this year.It is not just rich yacht owners who are cheating the system. Panaritis highlighted to CNN another dodge in which employers hire staff on one salary, declare a fraction, pay the employee the remainder in cash and avoid the full tax bill.Other Greeks have described to CNN how citizens pay a \"tip\" to tax officials to reduce the amount they pay.The government is trying to hit back. Panaritis says they have made \"superhuman\" efforts to reform Greece including introducing measures to tackle collusion between the public and the authorities -- something she describes as \"controlling the controller.\"\"We are establishing controls not only to the citizen but also to the collector -- the public servant,\" said Panaritis.She added that the government had created an independent tax authority, improved policing, harmonized accounting systems and introduced a special judge to deal with tax issues.But Maria Koutroumpa, a young Greek woman who has found work as a market analyst in London, says the Greek attitude towards paying taxes is only one part of the problem. She says many Greeks blame successive governments for mismanaging the economy and the decision to allow Greece into the euro.\"No-one cared about the country's future. People don't trust officials,\" she said. Panaritis, who worked for the World Bank and has specialist knowledge of public sector reform, accepts that there is a gulf in trust between the citizen and authority and says increased policing is not the whole answer. She believes that a series of incentives and benefits such as cutting bureaucracy and encouraging entrepreneurs is the way out of the crisis.\"We must deregulate and simplify -- that's what we should be pushing for rather than more fiscal measures. Greece has natural resources, we have human capital,\" she said.But reaction from one pressure group suggests that encouraging privatization will be a hard sell.Calling itself Den Plirono, which translates as 'I won't pay,' the group was originally set up to protest about highways going over to the private sector and the subsequent imposition of road tolls.But its opposition has spread to a string of extra taxes that were brought in during the summer's austerity measures.Den Plirono says it is not associated with any political party, and it claims to be growing, with 10,000 members and 50 committees across Greece.\"We already pay high taxes,\" said Vasilis Sarantopoulos, a spokesman for the group. \"Over the last few years, there has been an effort in Greece to give public and social goods to the private sector so it can exploit them and make a profit.

Two of the club's rivals, Manchester United and Arsenal, have stadiums that hold 76,000 and 60,000 respectively.A statement on the Chelsea's official website read: \"Chelsea FC is naturally disappointed with the result. A large number of fans supported our proposals but it was always going to be difficult when we had to have a 75 per cent majority of voting shareholders accepting them.\"We approached this process with transparency and the will to do what is best for Chelsea Football Club and while we will remain as ambitious as ever, this decision could slow down our progress.\"Buck added: \"Obviously we are disappointed but we recognise and we respect totally that the shareholders of Chelsea Pitch Owners have spoken. \"We will meet with Mr Abramovich (Chelsea's Russian owner) and the rest of the board and we will decide what action, if any, we will take going forward.'\"I don't view this as an us and against you, we against they situation.

World number one Wozniacki, who called the trainer on during her match after complaining of feeling sick, is rock bottom of the group after playing all three of her round robin games.After her victory Kvitova told CNN she was delighted to make the final four: \"It's nice when I win and I'm happy to be in the semi-final.

Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. The agency gave an alert about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata, as well as the eastern part of Sicily.Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa on Italy's northwest coast, in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been \"isolated, accessible only by sea\" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told state-run news agency ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it.That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday.\"The situation is much better compared to yesterday,\" Betta said. Italy's defense ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here.Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, the news agency stated.  ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow.The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train services in Liguria have been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks.Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 77, "end": 80, "mot": "CNN", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 865, "end": 884, "mot": "Corriere della Sera", "types": ["newspaper"], "type": []}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1149, "mot": "Servizio Meteorologico", "types": ["unit"], "type": []}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1593, "mot": "Angelo", "types": ["leader"], "type": []}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1631, "mot": "ANSA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2276, "mot": "ANSA", "types": ["company"], "type": []}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2866, "mot": "Livefyre", "types": ["company"], "type": []}], "counts": {"company": 4, "newspaper": 1, "unit": 1, "leader": 1}, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/27/world/europe/italy-flooding/index.html", "img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/111028124554-italy-flood-story-top.jpg", "dateTime": "2011-10-27T20:54:52Z"}, {"id": "0c26e3ee-cc40-5144-8e7e-66e6afcb5f76", "title": "McIlroy leads big-money Shanghai Masters", "content": "McIlroy leads big-money Shanghai MastersBy Updated 1625 GMT (0025 HKT) October 27, 2011 British golfer Rory McIlroy captured the first major of his career at this year's U.S. Open.Story highlightsRory McIlroy heads the leaderboard at the Shanghai Masters after first roundMcIlroy carded an opening round 68, one shot clear of Hunter Mahan in secondThe winner at the Lake Malaren Golf Club is set to receive a check for $2 millionWorld number three Rory McIlroy carded an opening round 64 on Thursday to finish eight-under-par and lead the Shanghai Masters by one shot.The U.S. Open champion is in pole position to claim the $2 million winner's check, a bigger prize than any of golf's four majors, at the 30-man invitational tournament which is not affiliated with any of the sport's professional tours.McIlroy, 22, is one shot clear of American Hunter Mahan after a bogey-free round at the Lake Malaren Golf Club which included five birdies on the back nine.\"Very happy with my opening 64 at the Shanghai Masters....

But despite a late equalizer, Levante came back with Suarez's stunning free kick, which saw them leapfrog Barcelona into top spot.Real Madrid did their best to keep up with Levante after blowing Villarreal away in the first half an hour at the Santiago Bernabeu. Villarreal, perennial UEFA Champions League qualifiers in recent years, have endured a torrid start to the season, made worse when Karim Benzema scored an early goal. Kaka was then set up by Argentine international Angel Di Maria, who capped a fine half by scoring the third. The match petered out in the second half, finishing 3-0 and sending Real Madrid second above Barcelona.In Italy's Serie A Udinese missed the chance of returning to the top of the league after losing away to Napoli 2-0. Two first half strikes from Ezequiel Lavezzi and Christian Maggio ended Udinese's unbeaten start to the season. But the result of the night saw AC Milan score four goals in successive games after beating Parma 4-1. Milan found themselves 3-0 down against Lecce last week before mounting a thrilling comeback. A second half Kevin Prince Boetang hat-trick secured an unlikely 4-3 victory and it was another three-goal haul that guaranteed all the points against Parma. This time Antonio Nocerino was the hero. His first half double put Milan in control before Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the victory beyond Parma, who scored a late consolation before Nocerino completed his hat-trick in the 90th minute.\"Right now the important thing is to return to the top and we can do that,\" coach Massimiliano Allegri told AFP.\"This is an important result to give us consistency. The table is starting  to get stretched and we must stay amongst the leaders.\"Powered by Livefyre", "ents": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "mot": "Levante", "types": ["association", "club"], "type":
